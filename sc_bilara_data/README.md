# sc_bilara_data

Folder for files from `bilara-data/published`. Content is copied literally over, except we transform from *nilakkhana* to HTML. 

These files are the basis for all SuttaCentralâ€™s segmented texts.

Folder update is triggered by changes to `bilara-data/published`. For further details see the README there.
