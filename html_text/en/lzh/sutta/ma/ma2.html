<p>Section 1: The Seven Dharmas</p>
<h1>2. The Pārijāta Tree</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a>I have heard thus: One time, the Buddha traveled to Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc2"></a>At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the bhikṣus: “If the leaves of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree wither and yellow, then the devas of the Thirty-Three are delighted and rejoice. It won't be long before the 'jāta tree's leaves fall.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc3"></a>“Furthermore, once the leaves of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree have fallen, then the devas of the Thirty-Three are delighted and rejoice. It won't be long before the 'jāta tree's leaves will grow back again.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc4"></a>“Furthermore, once the leaves of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree have grown back again, then the devas of the Thirty-Three are delighted and rejoice. It won't be long before the 'jāta tree grows webs [of buds].</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc5"></a>“Furthermore, once the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree has grown webs, then the devas of the Thirty-Three are delighted and rejoice. It won't be long before the 'jāta tree's [buds] grow like bird beaks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc6"></a>“Furthermore, once the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree has grown [buds] like bird beaks, then the devas of the Thirty-Three are delighted and rejoice. It won't be long before the 'jāta tree's [buds] will open like bowls.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc7"></a>“Furthermore, once the [buds] of Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree have opened like bowls, then the devas of the Thirty-Three are delighted and rejoice. It won't be long before the 'jāta tree will be in full bloom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc8"></a>“Once the 'jāta tree has fully bloomed, the light that it shines, the colors that it reflects, and the fragrance that it produces have a range of a hundred yojanas. During the four months of summer, the devas of the Thirty-Three then entertain themselves with the five heavenly pleasures and the virtues with which they are endowed. This is called the festival under the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc9"></a>“The meaning of the noble disciple is also so. When he considers leaving home, then the disciple is called ‘leaves turning yellow’ like the withering and yellowing leaves of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc10"></a>“Furthermore, the noble disciple shaves off his beard and hair, puts on the kāṣāya robes, becomes faithful, leaves home, goes homeless, and trains on the path. The noble disciple then is called ‘falling leaves’ like the leaves falling from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc11"></a>“Furthermore, the noble disciple parts with desire and parts with evil or unwholesome dharmas. With reasoning and investigation, this seclusion produces joy and happiness, and he attains the accomplishment of the first dhyāna. The noble disciple then is called ‘leaves growing back again’ like the leaves growing back on the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc12"></a>“Furthermore, once the noble disciple's reasoning and investigation have stopped, he possesses an inner clarity and unified mind without reasoning or investigation. This concentration produces joy and happiness, and he attains the accomplishment of the second dhyāna. The noble disciple then is called ‘growing webs [of buds]’ like the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree growing webs [of buds].</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc13"></a>“Furthermore, the noble disciple parts with joy and desire, and he is equanimous without pursuing it further. With right mindfulness and right knowledge, he personally experiences the happiness that's described by the nobles as the noble's equanimity, mindfulness, happy abode, and emptiness, and he attains the accomplishment of the third dhyāna. The noble disciple then is called ‘growing [buds] like bird beaks’ like the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree growing [buds] like bird beaks.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc14"></a>“Furthermore, the noble disciple's pleasure ceases and his pain ceases. The basis of joy and sorrow having ceased, he is neither discomforted nor delighted. Equanimous, mindful, and pure, he attains the accomplishment of the fourth dhyāna. The noble disciple then is called ‘becoming like a bowl’ like the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree [buds] becoming like bowls.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc15"></a>“Furthermore, once the noble disciple's contaminants have ended, his mind is liberated, and his wisdom is liberated. In the present, he knows and recognizes for himself the accomplishment of self-realization: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ He is no longer subject to existence and knows it as it really is. The noble disciple then is called ‘in full bloom’ like the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree in full bloom.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc16"></a>“He is an arhat bhikṣu whose contaminants have ended. The devas of the Thirty-Three assemble in the Correct Hall of the Good Dharma, sigh admiringly, and praise him, ‘Some worthy disciple at some town shaved off his beard and hair, put on the kāṣāya robes, became faithful, left home, went homeless, and trained on the path. Once his contaminants had ended, his mind was liberated, and his wisdom was liberated. In the present, he knew and recognized for himself the accomplishment of self-realization: “Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.” He is no longer subject to existence and knows is as it really is.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc17"></a>“This is called the assembly that coincides with the end of an arhat's contaminants, which is like the festival held under the Heaven of the Thirty-Three's 'jāta tree.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc18"></a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those bhikṣus who heard what the Buddha said rejoiced and handed it down.</p>
