<h1>The Good Dharma</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a><span class="evam">I have heard thus:</span> One time, the Buddha traveled to the kingdom of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc2"></a>At that time, the Bhagavān addressed the bhikṣus: “If a bhikṣu accomplishes seven things, then he will attain the happiness of the noble ones, and he will be rightly destined for the end of the contaminants. What are the seven? Namely, a bhikṣu knows the Dharma, knows the meaning, knows the time, knows moderation, knows himself, knows the assembly, and knows the greater likenesses of people.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc3"></a>“How does a bhikṣu know the Dharma? It means a bhikṣu knows the right sūtras, songs (geya), predictions (vyākaraṇa), gāthās (verses), histories (nidāna), stories (avadāna), past births (itivṛttaka), lectures (udāna), birth places (jātaka), extensive explanations (vaipulya), unprecedented things (adbhuta-dharma), and explanations of meaning (upadeśa). This is called a bhikṣu who knows the Dharma. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who doesn’t know the Dharma, which is to say that he doesn’t know the right sūtras, songs, predictions, gāthās, histories, stories, past births, lectures, birth places, extensive explanations, unprecedented things, and explanations of meaning. Such a bhikṣu doesn’t know the Dharma. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who well knows the Dharma, which is to say that he knows the right sūtras, songs, predictions, gāthās, histories, stories, past births, lectures, birth places, extensive explanations, unprecedented things, and explanations of meaning. This is called a bhikṣu who well knows the Dharma.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc4"></a>“How does a bhikṣu know the meaning? It means a bhikṣu knows the meaning of this or that expression is this or that meaning. This is called a bhikṣu who knows the meaning. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who doesn’t know the meaning, which is to say that he doesn’t know the meaning of this or that expression is this or that meaning. Such a bhikṣu doesn’t know the meaning. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who well knows<a class="t" id="421b"></a> the meaning, which is to say that he knows the meaning of this or that expression is this or that meaning. This is called a bhikṣu who well knows the meaning.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc5"></a>“How does a bhikṣu know the time? It means a bhikṣu knows the time to cultivate lower qualities, the time to cultivate higher qualities, and the time to cultivate qualities of indifference. This is called a bhikṣu who knows the time. Suppose there a bhikṣu who doesn’t know the time, which is to say that he doesn’t know the time to cultivate lower qualities, the time to cultivate higher qualities, and the time to cultivate qualities of indifference. Such a bhikṣu doesn’t know the time. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who well knows the time, which is to say that he knows the time to cultivate lower qualities, the time to cultivate higher qualities, and the time to cultivate qualities of indifference. This is called the bhikṣu who well knows the time.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc6"></a>“How does a bhikṣu know moderation? It means a bhikṣu knows moderation in drinking, eating, departing, standing, sitting, laying down, speaking, being silent, relieving himself, rousing himself when drowsy, and cultivating right knowledge. This is called a bhikṣu who knows moderation. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who doesn’t know moderation, which is to say that he doesn’t know it regarding drinking, eating, departing, standing, sitting, laying down, speaking, being silent, relieving himself, rousing himself when drowsy, and cultivating right knowledge. Such a bhikṣu doesn’t know moderation. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who well knows moderation, which is to say that he well knows it regarding drinking, eating, departing, standing, sitting, laying down, speaking, being silent, relieving himself, rousing himself when drowsy, and cultivating right knowledge. This is called a bhikṣu who well knows moderation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc7"></a>“How does a bhikṣu know himself? It means a bhikṣu knows ‘Such are my attainments of belief, discipline, learning, generosity, wisdom, discernment, and the Āgamas.’ This is called a bhikṣu who knows himself. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who doesn’t know himself, which is to say that he doesn’t know ‘Such are my attainments of belief, discipline, learning, generosity, wisdom, discernment, and the Āgamas.’ Such a bhikṣu doesn’t know himself. Suppose a bhikṣu well knows himself, which is to say that he knows ‘Such are my attainments of belief, discipline, learning, generosity, wisdom, discernment, and the Āgamas.’ This is called a bhikṣu who well knows himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc8"></a>“How does a bhikṣu know the assembly? It means a bhikṣu knows ‘This is a kṣatriya assembly, this is a brāhmaṇa assembly, this is a householder assembly, and this is a śramaṇa assembly. In those assemblies, I should thus go, thus stand, thus sit, thus speak, and thus be silent.’ This is called a bhikṣu who knows the assembly. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who doesn’t know the assembly, which is to say that he doesn’t know ‘This is a kṣatriya assembly, this is a brāhmaṇa assembly, this is a householder assembly, and this is a śramaṇa assembly. In those assemblies, I should thus<a class="t" id="421c"></a> go, thus stand, thus sit, thus speak, and thus be silent.’ Such a bhikṣu doesn’t know the assembly. Suppose there is a bhikṣu who well knows the assembly, which is to say that he well knows ‘This is a kṣatriya assembly, this is a brāhmaṇa assembly, this is a householder assembly, and this is a śramaṇa assembly. In those assemblies, I should thus go, thus stand, thus sit, thus speak, and thus be silent.’ This is called a bhikṣu who well knows the assembly.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc9"></a>“How does a bhikṣu know the greater likenesses of people? It means a bhikṣu knows there are two kinds of people: believers and non-believers. If someone is a believer, he is greater; a non-believer is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc10"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of faithful people: those who frequently go to see the bhikṣus and those who don't frequently go to see the bhikṣus. If someone frequently goes to see the bhikṣus, he is greater; someone who doesn’t frequently go to see the bhikṣus is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc11"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who frequently go to see the bhikṣus: those who revere the bhikṣus and those who don't revere the bhikṣus. If someone reveres the bhikṣus, he is greater; someone who doesn’t revere the bhikṣus is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc12"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who revere the bhikṣus: those who have questions about the sūtras and those who don't have questions about the sūtras. If someone asks about the sūtras, he is greater; someone who doesn't ask about the sūtras is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc13"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who ask about the sūtras: those who single-mindedly listen to the sūtras and those who don't single-mindedly listen to the sūtras. If someone single-mindedly listens to the sūtras, he is greater; someone who doesn't single-mindedly listen to the sūtras is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc14"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who single-mindedly listen to the sūtras: those who hear and retain the Dharma and those who hear but don't retain the Dharma. If someone hears and retains the Dharma, he is greater; someone who hears but doesn't retain the Dharma is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc15"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who hear and retain the Dharma: those who hear the Dharma and contemplate its meaning and those who hear the Dharma but don't contemplate its meaning. If someone hears the Dharma and contemplates its meaning, he is greater; someone who hears the Dharma but doesn't contemplate its meaning is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc16"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who hear the Dharma and contemplate its meaning: those who know the Dharma, know its meaning, go from one Dharma to the next Dharma, conform to the Dharma, and conduct themselves according to the Dharma; and those who don't know the Dharma, don't know its meaning, don't go from one Dharma to the next Dharma, don't conform to the Dharma, and don't conduct themselves according to the Dharma. If someone knows the Dharma, knows its meaning, goes from one Dharma to the next Dharma, conforms to the Dharma, and conducts himself according to the Dharma, he is greater. Someone who doesn't know the Dharma, doesn't know its meaning, doesn't go from one Dharma to the next Dharma, doesn't conform to the Dharma, and doesn't conduct himself according to the Dharma is not.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc17"></a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who know the Dharma, know its meaning, go from one Dharma to the next Dharma, conform to the Dharma, and conduct themselves according to the Dharma: those who benefit themselves, benefit others, benefit many people, pity the world, seek both meaning and benefit for devas and humans,<a class="t" id="422a"></a> and seek peace and happiness; and those who don't benefit themselves, don't benefit others, don't benefit many people, don't pity the world, don't seek both meaning and benefit for devas and humans, and don't seek peace and happiness. If someone benefits himself, benefits others, benefits many people, pities the world, seeks both meaning and benefit for devas and humans, and seeks peace and happiness, this person is the very best among people. He is great, superior, exceptional, greater, honored, and wondrous.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc18"></a>“It’s just as there is milk because of the cow, there is cream because of milk, there is butter because of cream, there is refined butter because of butter, and there is ghee because of refined butter. Ghee is the very best of those things. It is great, superior, exceptional, greater, honored, and wondrous. Thus is the person who benefits himself, benefits others, benefits many people, pities the world, seeks both meaning and benefit for devas and humans, and seeks peace and happiness. Of these pairs of people as they've been described, as they've been discerned, and as they've been defined, he is the best, great, superior, exceptional, greater, honored, and wondrous. This is called a bhikṣu who knows the greater likenesses of people.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc19"></a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those bhikṣus who heard what the Buddha had taught rejoiced and handed it down.</p>
