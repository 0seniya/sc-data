<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp376" id="376"></a>Though there are a thousand sayings consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one useful word,<br>
hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp377" id="377"></a>One may speak a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one verse of Dhamma,<br>
hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp378" id="378"></a>One may conquer a thousand men a thousand times in a battle,<br>
but having conquered another, one’s self,<br>
one would surely be supreme in battle.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp379" id="379"></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>
month by month for a hundred years;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second—<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp380" id="380"></a>One person might care for the fire in the woods for a hundred years;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second—<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp381" id="381"></a>Whatever the alms or the sacrifice in the world<br>
the one seeking merit may give for a year,<br>
all that comes not to a quarter of the merit—<br>
better is the worship of the upright.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp382" id="382"></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>
month by month for a hundred years;<br>
but that is not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of having confidence in the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp383" id="383"></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>
month by month for a hundred years;<br>

<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp384" id="384"></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>
month by month for a hundred years;<br>
but that is not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of having confidence in the Saṅgha.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp385" id="385"></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>
month by month for a hundred years;<br>
but that is not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of those who have mastered Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp386" id="386"></a>From month to month the fool<br>
may eat food with the tip of <i>kusa</i> grass,<br>
but that is not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of having confidence in the Buddha.</p>

<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp390" id="390"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
unvirtuous and uncomposed,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one with virtue and meditation.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp391" id="391"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
lacking in wisdom and uncomposed,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one endowed with wisdom and meditation.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp392" id="392"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
indolent, with less energy,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one with energy set up and firm.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp393" id="393"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
without seeing rise and fall,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for the one seeing rise and fall.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp394" id="394"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
without seeing the supreme state,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one seeing the supreme state.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp395" id="395"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
without seeing the deathless state,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one seeing the deathless state.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp396" id="396"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
unestablished in the True Dhamma,<br>

for one who knows the True Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp397" id="397"></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
having not attained the destruction of the pollutants,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one who has attained the destruction of the pollutants.</p>
