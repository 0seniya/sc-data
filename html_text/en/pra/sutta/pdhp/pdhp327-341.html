<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp327" id="327"></a>The people give according to faith,<br>
according to their confidence,<br>
herein the one who becomes depressed<br>
because of food and drink given to others,<br>
does not, either by day or night,<br>
attain to good concentration.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp328" id="328"></a>For the one in whom this depression is cut off,<br>
destroyed at the root, dug up,<br>
does, by day and night,<br>
attain to good concentration.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp329" id="329"></a>Like a good horse touched by the whip,<br>
living ardent and spiritually intense.<br>
Having faith, virtue and energy,<br>
concentration and insight into the Dhamma,<br>
well-established in patience, meekness and concentration,<br>
they have come to the essence of wisdom and learning.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp330" id="330"></a>He who acquires faith and wisdom unsurpassed in this very life,<br>
has great wealth in the world,<br>
other wealth, though great, is useless.<br></p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp331" id="331"></a>The faithful one who is possessed of virtue,<br>
and has wealth and fame,<br>
whatever district he resorts to,<br>
right there and then he is worshipped.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp332" id="332"></a>Faith is a person’s travelling companion,<br>
he would not accept travelling without faith,<br>
from that there will be fame and renown for him,<br>
and when he abandons the body he goes to heaven.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp333" id="333"></a>The person who is beyond mere faith,<br>
who knows that which is unmade,<br>
who has cut off rebirth-linking,<br>
who has destroyed the occasion,<br>
who has thrown out hope and desire,<br>
is surely the person supreme.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp334" id="334"></a>It is rare the arising of Buddhas,<br>
rare the teaching of the Dhamma,<br>
it is rare to acquire faith,<br>
rare is the life of mortals.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp335" id="335"></a>For the one with unsettled mind,<br>
who does not know the True Dhamma,<br>
whose confidence is wavering, <br>
wisdom is unfulfilled.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp336" id="336"></a>For one who has a mind lacking confidence,<br>
that is base or agitated,<br>
and frequently impetuous,<br>
it is not possible to understand the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp337" id="337"></a>He who has removed impetuosity,<br>
displeasure from his mind,<br>
with confident mind, happy,<br>
he can understand well-spoken words.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp338" id="338"></a>Acquiring birth as a human,<br>
or going to the heavens,<br>
or having sole sovereignty over the earth—<br>
better is the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp339-340" id="339-340"></a>He whose faith in the Realised One<br>
is well-established and unmoveable,<br>
whose virtue is beautiful,<br>
praised by the noble ones,<br>
who has confidence in the Saṅgha,<br>
who sees uprightly,<br>
he they say is ‘not poor’,<br>
his life is not in vain.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp341" id="341"></a>Therefore with faith, virtue, confidence and insight into Dhamma,<br>
a sage should devote himself to the essence of the Buddhas’ dispensation.</p>
