<h1>19. The Chapter about the Mind</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp342" id="342"></a>An agitated, unsteady mind,<br>
difficult to guard, difficult to ward,<br>
the sagacious one makes straight,<br>
as a fletcher does his arrows.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp343" id="343"></a>Like a fish thrown up on dry land,<br>
pulled out from its watery home,<br>
the mind is agitated,<br>
one ought to throw off the sway of Māra.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp344" id="344"></a>Those who will restrain the mind that roams far,<br>
is lonesome, without a body, hidden,<br>
gain release from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp345" id="345"></a>For the mind that is difficult to subdue, flighty,<br>
flitting wherever it will,<br>
restraint is good,<br>
a restrained mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp346" id="346"></a>Hard to see, very subtle,<br>
flitting wherever it will,<br>
the sage should guard the mind,<br>
for guarded it brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp347" id="347"></a>For the one with mind that is not dependent,<br>
for the one with mind unperplexed,<br>
having abandoned the wholesome and demerit,<br>
for the watchful, there is no fear.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp348" id="348"></a>The one who drinks the tasty<br>
Dhamma drink, with a clear mind,<br>
the wise one will always delight<br>
in the Dhamma that is made known by the Noble.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp349" id="349"></a>Before long has passed by, alas, this body will lie on the ground,<br>
rejected, without consciousness,<br>
just like a useless piece of wood.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp350" id="350"></a>Knowing this body is frail like a jar,<br>
govern the mind like a fortress,<br>
one should fight Māra with the weapon of wisdom,<br>
guard your success, and do not be attached.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp351" id="351"></a>Just as the rain penetrates a house with thatching that is poor,<br>
so passion penetrates a mind that is undeveloped.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp352" id="352"></a>Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,<br>
so passion cannot penetrate a mind that is well-developed.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp353" id="353"></a>Just as the rain penetrates a house with thatching that is poor,<br>
so hatred penetrates a mind that is undeveloped.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp354" id="354"></a>Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,<br>
so hatred cannot penetrate a mind that is well-developed.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp355" id="355"></a>Just as the rain penetrates a house with thatching that is poor,<br>
so delusion penetrates a mind that is undeveloped.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp356" id="356"></a>Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,<br>
so delusion cannot penetrate a mind that is well-developed.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp357" id="357"></a>The non-doing of anything wicked, undertaking of what is good,<br>
the training of one’s mind—this is the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
