<h1>7. The Chapter about the Wholesome</h1>
</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp96" id="96"></a>Hasten to do wholesome deeds,<br>
ward off the mind from wickedness,<br>
for the mind of the one slow in merit delights in wickedness.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp97" id="97"></a>Should a person do that which is wicked,<br>
he should not do it again and again,<br>
let him not place his intention in it,<br>
for there is an accumulation of suffering for the wicked one.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp98" id="98"></a>If a person should make merit,<br>
he should do it again and again,<br>
let him place his intention there,<br>
there is an increase of joy for the one who has made merit.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp99" id="99"></a>For the pure one there is always fasting,<br>
for the pure one there is always the fast day,<br>
for the pure one, the one of clean deeds,<br>
his vow always succeeds.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp100" id="100"></a>Better undone is a wrong-doing,<br>
a wrong-doing one later regrets,<br>
he grieves, thinking: “I have done a bad deed,”<br>
gone to a bad fate, he grieves much more.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp101" id="101"></a>Better done is what is well-done, which,<br>
when done, one does not regret<br>
he is happy, thinking: “I have done a good deed,”<br>
gone to a good fate, he is happy much more.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp102" id="102"></a>Even the wicked one experiences good fortune <br>
while the wickedness does not ripen,<br>
but when the wickedness ripens<br>
then the wicked one experiences wicked things.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp103" id="103"></a>Even the fortunate one experiences wickedness <br>
as long as the good fortune does not ripen,<br>
but when the fortune ripens<br>
then the fortunate one experiences good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp104" id="104"></a>Even the wicked one does good<br>
while the wickedness does not ripen,<br>
but when the time has gone by<br>
the wicked one experiences wicked things.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp105" id="105"></a>Even the fortunate one does wickedness<br>
as long as the good fortune does not ripen,<br>
but when the time has gone by<br>
the fortunate one experiences good fortune.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp106" id="106"></a>If there is no wound for him in his hand<br>
he can carry poison with his hand,<br>
poison does not enter without a wound,<br>
there is no wickedness for the one who does not do wrong.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp107" id="107"></a>A wicked deed that has been done,<br>
like milk, does not turn all at once,<br>
smouldering, it follows the fool,<br>
like a fire covered with ashes.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp108" id="108"></a>A wicked deed that has been done,<br>
like a knife, does not cut all at once,<br>
 but when death comes he knows<br>
the destiny of those who do wickedness.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp109" id="109"></a>You should prepare beforehand what is to be done,<br>
do not tremble at what is to be done at the time for it,<br>
for such a one who has prepared what is to be done,<br>
does not tremble at what is to be done at the time for it.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp110" id="110"></a>One should prepare to do that<br>
which one knows is for one’s welfare,<br>
the sage, the wise one should make effort,<br>
not with the thinking of the charioteer.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp111-112" id="111-112"></a>As the charioteer who abandoned the smooth path of the highway,<br>
and approached the rough path,<br>
then he broods, as upon a broken axle,<br>
so the one departing from Dhamma<br>
and following what is not Dhamma,<br>
when that fool comes to Death’s jaws he broods,<br>
as upon a broken axle.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp113" id="113"></a>Many wearing the monastic robe around their necks<br>
are wicked, unrestrained.<br>
Wicked ones! Through your wicked deeds,<br>
you re-arise in the underworld.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp114" id="114"></a>One who speaks what is untrue goes to the underworld,<br>
he who says: ‘I do not do’ what he has done,<br>
both of these are just the same when they have gone<br>
to the hereafter, they are humans who did base deeds.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp115" id="115"></a>He who offends against the inoffensive one,<br>
a purified and passionless person:<br>
that wicked deed then returns to the fool,<br>
like fine dust that is thrown against the wind.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp116" id="116"></a>Like a merchant on a fearful path,<br>
with few friends and great wealth,<br>
as one loving life would avoid poison,<br>
so should one avoid wicked deeds.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp117" id="117"></a>He who desires happiness for himself<br>
by causing suffering for another,<br>
being associated thus with hatred,<br>
is not fully released from suffering.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp118" id="118"></a>The smell of a corpse is cut off eventually,<br>
also of one bloated<br>
when nights have passed,<br>
but of the man who lives not by Dhamma<br>
day by day his smell is never cut off.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp119" id="119"></a>Just as householders having great treasures,<br>
when the city is on fire and burning,<br>
because of their pearls, jewels, crystal and silver,<br>
make effort, thinking: “We will save something”,<br>
so the ascetics of great wisdom,<br>
noble ones training along the noble path,<br>
oppressed with the fear of birth,<br>
old age, death, afflicted by suffering,<br>
make effort, thinking: “We will attain peace”.</p>
