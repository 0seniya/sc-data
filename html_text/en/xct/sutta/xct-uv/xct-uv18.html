</div>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh1"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.1"></a>Who is there that can overcome the world of the gods, of the lord of death <span class="add">(Yama)</span> and of men, who knows how to expose the most delightful law, as one would flowers?</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh2"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.2"></a>It is the disciple <span class="add">(sekhas)</span> who can overcome the world of the gods, of the lord of death and of men, who knows how to expose the most delightful law, as one would flowers.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh3"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.3"></a>Fear is born of the forest <span class="add">(of ignorance)</span>; so cut down not <span class="add">(only)</span> the trees of the forest, but all that appertains to the forest <span class="add">(i.e., the roots)</span>, and then the Śramana will find nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh4"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.4"></a>If man destroys not everything that appertains to the forest down to the smallest part, his mind will be held in bondage, as the calf that wants milk is to its mother's side.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh5"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.5"></a>Cut out the love of self as you would an autumn lotus; cherish the road of peace on account of the nirvāṇa which the Victorious One has explained.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh6"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.6"></a>Like a pretty flower, of pleasing colour but without scent, are the agreeably spoken but fruitless words of one who does not act <span class="add">(accordingly)</span>.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh7"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.7"></a>As the bee, which harms neither the colour nor the scent of the flower, but having sucked it flies away, so let the Muni walk through a village.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh8"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.8"></a>Remarking not the sins of others, and what they have done or left undone, one should remark what he himself does right or wrong.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh9"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.9"></a>As on piles of filth and in dirty water grows, unaffected by them, the padma, pure, sweet-smelling, and lovely.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh10"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.12"></a>So the disciple of the perfect Buddha shines by his wisdom among other men, who are blind and <span class="add">(like)</span> a heap of filth.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh11"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.13"></a>As out of a heap of flowers many garlands are made, so when a man has been born he can do many virtuous deeds.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh12"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.10"></a>As the vakula plant in summer sheds all its flowers, so let the Bhixu drop passions, hatred, and ignorance.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh13"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.11"></a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering flowers, the lord of death carries him off as the flood does a sleeping village.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh14"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.14"></a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering flowers, falls into the power of the lord of death without having satisfied his desires.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh15"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.15"></a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering: flowers, falls into the power of the lord of death without him having acquired wealth <span class="add">(enough to satisfy him)</span>.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh16"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.16"></a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering flowers, falls into the power of the lord of death without having arrived at the object of his pursuit.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh17"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.17"></a>He who has perceived that this body is <span class="add">(empty)</span> as a vase, and who knows that all things <span class="add">(dharma)</span> are as an illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh18"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.19"></a>He who has perceived that this world is like froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh19"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.18"></a>He who has perceived that this body is like froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh20"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.20"></a><span class="add">Repetition of verse 18.</span></p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh21"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.21"></a>The Bhixu who knows that existence is without reality, like an udumbāra flower, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh22"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.21A"></a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of passion, as one does the flower from the water-born <span class="add">(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh23"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.21B"></a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of hatred, as one does the flower from the water-born <span class="add">(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh24"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.21C"></a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of ignorance, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class="add">(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh25"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.21D"></a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of egotism, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class="add">(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh26"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.21E"></a>The Bhixu who cuts of every particle of affection, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class="add">(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh27"></a><a class="vvuv" id="18.21F"></a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of desire, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class="add">(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
