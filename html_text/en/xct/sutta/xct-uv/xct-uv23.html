<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh1"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.1"></a>Learn what has been well explained, associate only with Śramanas, <span class="add">(live)</span> in seclusion and with only a single mat, and thy mind will be at rest.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh2"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.2"></a>He who has but a single mat, one resting-place <span class="add">(the earth?)</span>, who is without indolence, who dwells alone in a forest, he will learn to control himself.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh3"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.3"></a>He who conquers a thousand times a thousand men in battle, a greater conqueror than he is he who conquers himself.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh4"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.4"></a>He who by continual control has conquered himself has by this one conquest gained so great a victory that that over the rest of mankind could not add to it.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh5"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.5"></a>The Bhixu who has conquered through knowledge, Māra and Brahmā cannot defeat him, nor can a Deva or a Gandharva.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh6"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.7"></a>If one in the first place has done that which is right, he can afterwards discipline others to be like himself; if one in the first place has done that which is right, afterwards the wise man and those he shall have disciplined will be free from suffering.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh7"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.8"></a>If a man make others as he has made himself, then, being subdued and at rest, he can educate others to be happy.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh8"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.9"></a>If a man would make others as he has made himself, ah! let yourself be well subdued, for it is difficult to subdue one's self.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh9"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.10"></a>One must give up what is beneficial to the multitude for what is for one's own good; when one has found that which is so greatly beneficial to himself, let him make his own welfare his chief concern.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh10"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.12"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? The wise man who has become master of himself finds great profit.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh11"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.13"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? The wise man who has become master of himself finds the law.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh12"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.16"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? The wise man who has become master of himself finds what is glorious.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh13"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? The wise man who has become master of himself finds happiness.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh14"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.17"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? The wise man who has become master of himself finds how to reach felicity.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh15"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.18-19"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? The wise man who has become master of himself will find joy for a long time in heaven.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh16"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.21"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? The wise man who has become master of himself is a beacon to his relatives.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh17"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.22"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? He who has become master of himself will find no pain in the midst of sorrow.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh18"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.23"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? He who has become master of himself cuts off all bonds.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh19"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.24"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? He who has become master of himself casts off all evil births.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh20"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.25"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? He who has become master of himself finds a patron in himself.</p>
<p><a class="wrh" id="wrh21"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.11"></a><a class="vvuv" id="23.23"></a>Self is the lord of self; what other lord could there be? He who becomes master of himself draws nigh unto nirvāṇa itself <span class="add">(or unto the real destruction of sorrow)</span>.</p>
