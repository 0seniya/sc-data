<h1>173. Clinging</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of clinging? What four? Clinging to sensual pleasure, clinging to views, clinging to rules and vows, clinging to a doctrine of self. These are the four kinds of clinging. This Noble Eightfold Path is to be developed for direct knowledge of these four kinds of clinging, for the full understanding of them, for their utter destruction, for their abandoning.”</p>
