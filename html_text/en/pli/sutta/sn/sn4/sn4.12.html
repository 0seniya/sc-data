<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly. <a class="pts_pn" id="sn.i.110"></a></p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc2"></a>Then it occurred to Mara the Evil One: “This ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly. Let me approach the ascetic Gotama in order to confound them.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc3"></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc4"></a> “Why now do you roar like a lion,<br>
Confident in the assembly?<br>
For there is one who’s a match for you,<br>
So why think yourself the victor?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="speaker">The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc5"></a> “The great heroes roar their lion’s roar<br>
Confident in the assemblies—<br>
The Tathagatas endowed with the powers<br>
Have crossed over attachment to the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
