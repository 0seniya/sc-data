<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="jw" id="jw37"></a>
On Candabhāgā River’s bank,<br>
I was a <i lang="pli">kinnarī</i> back then.<br>
I saw the Stainless Buddha <span class="add">there</span>,<br>
Self-Become, the Unconquered One. <a class="vjw" id="vjw1"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw38"></a>
Happy, with pleasure in <span class="add">my</span> heart,<br>
awe-struck, with hands pressed together,<br>
taking a garland made of reeds,<br>
I worshipped the Self-Become One. <a class="vjw" id="vjw2"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw39-40"></a>
Due to that karma done very well,<br>
I went to the Thirty-Three <span class="add">Gods</span>.<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of thirty-six kings of the gods. <a class="vjw" id="vjw3"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw40"></a>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of ten kings who were wheel-turners.<br>
My heart being agitated,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class="vjw" id="vjw4"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw42"></a>
My defilements are <span class="add">now</span> burnt up;<br>
existence has been slain for me.<br>
All <span class="add">my</span> defilements are destroyed;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class="vjw" id="vjw5"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw41"></a>
In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I did <i lang="pli">pūjā</i> <span class="add">with</span> that flower,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang="pli">pūjā</i>. <a class="vjw" id="vjw6"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw43"></a>
My defilements are <span class="add">now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class="add">new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class="vjw" id="vjw7"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw44"></a>
Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw8"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw45"></a>
The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw9"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Tīṇinaḷamālikā spoke these verses.</p>
<p class="endsutta">The legend of Tīṇinaḷamālikā Therī is finished.</p>
