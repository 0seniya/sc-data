<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="vns" id="vns402"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp400"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_488"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv402"></a>In the fair city of Patna, earth’s fairest city,<br>
Named for its beauty after the Trumpet-flower,<br>
Dwelt two saintly Sisters, born of the Sākiyas,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="vns" id="vns403"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp401"></a><a class="pts" id="pts163"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_489"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv403"></a>Isidāsī the one, Bodhi the other.<br>
Precept-observers, lovers of Jhāna-rapture,<br>
Learnèd ladies and cleansed from the taint of all worldliness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="vns" id="vns404"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp402"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_490"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv404"></a>These having made their round, and broken their fasting,<br>
Washed their bowls, and sitting in happy seclusion,<br>
Spake thus one to the other, asking and answering:</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="vns" id="vns405"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp403"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_491"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv405"></a>‘Thou hast a lovely mien, Isidāsī,<br>
Fresh and unwithered yet thy woman’s prime,<br>
What flaw in the life yonder hast thou seen,<br>
That thou didst choose surrender for thy lot?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="vns" id="vns406"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp404"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_492"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv406"></a>Then in that quiet spot Isidāsī,<br>
Skilled in the exposition of the Norm,<br>
Took up her tale and thus did make reply:<br>
‘Hear, Bodhi, how it was that I came forth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="vns" id="vns407"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp405"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_493"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv407"></a>In Ujjenī, Avantī’s foremost town,<br>
My father dwells, a virtuous citizen,<br>
His only daughter I, his well-beloved,<br>
The fondly cherished treasure of his life.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="vns" id="vns408"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp406"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_494"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv408"></a>Now from Sāketa came a citizen<br>
Of the first rank and rich exceedingly<br>
To ask my hand in marriage for his son.<br>
And father gave me him, as daughter-in-law.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="vns" id="vns409"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp407"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_495"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv409"></a>My salutation morn and eve I brought<br>
To both the parents of my husband, low<br>
Bowing my head and kneeling at their feet,<br>
According to the training given me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="vns" id="vns410"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp408"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_496"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv410"></a>My husband’s sisters and his brothers too,<br>
And all his kin, scarce were they entered when<br>
I rose in timid zeal and gave them place.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="vns" id="vns411"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp409"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_497"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv411"></a>And as to food, or boiled or dried, and drink,<br>
That which was to be stored I set aside,<br>
And served it out and gave to whom ’twas due.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="vns" id="vns412"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp410"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_498"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv412"></a>Rising betimes, I went about the house,<br>
Then with my hands and feet well cleansed I went<br>
To bring respectful greeting to my lord,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="vns" id="vns413"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp411"></a><a class="pts" id="pts164"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_499"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv413"></a>And taking comb and mirror, unguents, soap,<br>
I dressed and groomed him as a handmaid might.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="13"></a><a class="vns" id="vns414"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp412"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_500"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv414"></a>I boiled the rice, I washed the pots and pans;<br>
And as a mother on her only child,<br>
So did I minister to my good man.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="14"></a><a class="vns" id="vns415"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp413"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_501"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv415"></a>For me, who with toil infinite thus worked,<br>
And rendered service with a humble mind,<br>
Rose early, ever diligent and good,<br>
For me he nothing felt save sore dislike.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="15"></a><a class="vns" id="vns416"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp414"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_502"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv416"></a>Nay, to his mother and his father he<br>
Thus spake:—‘Give ye me leave and I will go,<br>
For not with Isidāsī will I live<br>
Beneath one roof, nor ever dwell with her.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="vns" id="vns417"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp415"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_503"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv417"></a>‘O son, speak not on this wise of thy wife,<br>
For wise is Isidāsī and discreet,<br>
An early riser and a housewife diligent.<br>
Say, doth she find no favour in thine eyes?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="17"></a><a class="vns" id="vns418"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp416"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_504"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv418"></a>‘In nothing doth she work me harm, and yet<br>
With Isidāsī will I never live.<br>
I cannot suffer her. Let be, let be!<br>
Give ye me leave and I will go away.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="18"></a><a class="vns" id="vns419"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp417"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_505"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv419"></a>And when they heard, mother and father-in-law<br>
Asked of me: ‘What then hast thou done t’ offend?<br>
Speak to us freely, child, and speak the truth.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="19"></a><a class="vns" id="vns420"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp418"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_506"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv420"></a>‘Naught have I done that could offend, nor harm,<br>
Nor nagged at evil words. What can I do,<br>
That me my husband should so sore mislike?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="20"></a><a class="vns" id="vns421"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp419"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_507"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv421"></a>To guard and keep their son, they took me back,<br>
Unwilling guides, to father’s house, distressed,<br>
Distraught: ‘Alas! we’re beaten, pretty Luck!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="21"></a><a class="vns" id="vns422"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp420"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_508"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv422"></a>Then father gave me for the second time as bride,<br>
Content with half my husband’s sire had paid.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="22"></a><a class="vns" id="vns423"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp421"></a><a class="pts" id="pts165"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_509"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv423"></a>From that house too, when I had dwelt a month,<br>
I was sent back, though I had worked and served,<br>
Blameless and virtuous, as any slave.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="23"></a><a class="vns" id="vns424"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp422"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_510"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv424"></a>And yet a third, a friar begging alms—<br>
One who had self controlled, and could control<br>
Favour in fellow-men—my father met<br>
And spake him thus: ‘Be thou my son-in-law!<br>
Come, throw away that ragged robe and pot!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="24"></a><a class="vns" id="vns425"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp423"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_511"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv425"></a>He came, and so we dwelt one half moon more<br>
Together. Then to father thus he spake:<br>
‘O give me back my frock, my bowl and cup.<br>
Let me away to seek once more my scraps.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="25"></a><a class="vns" id="vns426"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp424"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_512"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv426"></a>Then to him father, mother, all the tribe<br>
Of kinsfolk clamouring: ‘What is it then<br>
Here dwelling likes you not? Say quick, what is’t<br>
That we can do to make you better pleased?’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="26"></a><a class="vns" id="vns427"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp425"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_513"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv427"></a>Then he: ‘If for myself I can suffice,<br>
Enough for me. One thing I know:—beneath<br>
One roof with Isidāsī I’ll not live!’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="27"></a><a class="vns" id="vns428"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp426"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_514"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv428"></a>Dismissed he went. I too, alone I thought.<br>
And then I asked my parents’ leave to die,<br>
Or, that they suffer me to leave the world.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="28"></a><a class="vns" id="vns429"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp427"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_515"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv429"></a>Now Lady Jinadattā on her beat<br>
Came by my father’s house for daily alms,<br>
Mindful of every moral precept, she,<br>
Learnèd and expert in the Vinaya.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="29"></a><a class="vns" id="vns430"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp428"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_516"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv430"></a>And seeing her we rose, and I prepared<br>
A seat for her, and as she sat I knelt,<br>
Then gave her food, both boiled and dried,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="30"></a><a class="vns" id="vns431"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp429"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_517"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv431"></a>And water—dishes we had set aside—<br>
And satisfied her hunger. Then I said:<br>
‘Lady, I wish to leave the world.’ ‘Why here,’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="31"></a><a class="vns" id="vns432"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp430"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_518"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv432"></a>My father said, ‘dear child, is scope for thee<br>
To walk according to the Norm. With food<br>
And drink canst gratify the holy folk<br>
And the twice-born. But of my father I,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="32"></a><a class="vns" id="vns433"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp431"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_519"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv433"></a>Weeping and holding out clasped hands, besought:<br>
‘Nay, but the evil karma I have done,<br>
That would I expiate and wear away.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="33"></a><a class="vns" id="vns434"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp432"></a><a class="pts" id="pts166"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_520"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv434"></a>Then father said: ‘Win thou Enlightenment<br>
And highest Truth, and gain Nibbana.<br>
That Hath He, the Best of Beings, realized.’</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="34"></a><a class="vns" id="vns435"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp433"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_521"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv435"></a>Then to my mother and my father dear,<br>
And all my kinsfolk tribe I bade farewell.<br>
And only seven days had I gone forth<br>
Ere I had touched and won the Threefold Lore.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="35"></a><a class="vns" id="vns436"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp434"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_522"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv436"></a>Then did I come to know my former births,<br>
E’en seven thereof, and how e’en now I reap<br>
The harvest, the result, that then I sowed.<br>
That will I now declare to thee, an thou<br>
Wilt listen single-minded to my tale.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="36"></a><a class="vns" id="vns437"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp435"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_523"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv437"></a>In Erakaccha’s town of yore I lived,<br>
A wealthy craftsman in all works of gold.<br>
Incensed by youth’s hot blood, a wanton, I<br>
Assailed the virtue of my neighbours’ wives.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="37"></a><a class="vns" id="vns438"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp436"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_524"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv438"></a>Therefrom deceasing, long I cooked in hell,<br>
Till, fully ripened, I emerged, and then<br>
Found rebirth in the body of an ape.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="38"></a><a class="vns" id="vns439"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp437"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_525"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv439"></a>Scarce seven days I lived before the great<br>
Dog-ape, the monkeys’ chief, castrated me.<br>
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="39"></a><a class="vns" id="vns440"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp438"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_526"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv440"></a>Therefrom deceasing in the woods of Sindh,<br>
Reborn the offspring of a one-eyed goat</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="40"></a><a class="vns" id="vns441"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp439"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_527"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv441"></a>And lame; twelve years a gelding, gnawn by worms,<br>
Unfit, I carried children on my back.<br>
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="41"></a><a class="vns" id="vns442"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp440"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_528"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv442"></a>Therefrom deceasing, I again found birth,<br>
The offspring of a cattle-dealer’s cow,<br>
A calf of lac-red hue; in the twelfth month</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="42"></a><a class="vns" id="vns443"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp441"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_529"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv443"></a>Castrated, yoked, I drew the plough and cart,<br>
Purblind and worried, driven and unfit.<br>
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="43"></a><a class="vns" id="vns444"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp442"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_530"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv444"></a>Therefrom deceasing, even in the street<br>
I came to birth, child of a household slave,<br>
Neither of woman nor of man my sex.<br>
Such was the fruit of my lasciviousness.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="44"></a><a class="vns" id="vns445"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp443"></a><a class="pts" id="pts167"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_531"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv445"></a>At thirty years of age I died, and was reborn<br>
A girl, the daughter of a carter, poor<br>
And of ill-fortune, and oppressed with debts<br>
Incurred to usurers. To pay the sum</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="45"></a><a class="vns" id="vns446"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp444"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_532"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv446"></a>Of interest that ever grew and swelled,<br>
In place of money, woeful little me<br>
The merchant of a caravan dragged off,<br>
Bearing me weeping from my home.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="46"></a><a class="vns" id="vns447"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp445"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_533"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv447"></a>Now in my sixteenth year, when I<br>
Blossomed a maiden, that same merchant’s son,<br>
Giridāsa the name of him, loved me<br>
And made me wife. Another wife he had,</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="47"></a><a class="vns" id="vns448"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp446"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_534"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv448"></a>A virtuous dame of parts and of repute,<br>
Enamoured of her mate. And thus I brought<br>
Discord and enmity within that house.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="48"></a><a class="vns" id="vns449"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp447"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_535"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv449"></a>Fruit of my karma was it thus that they,<br>
In this last life, have slighted me, e’en tho’<br>
I waited on them as their humble slave.<br>
Well! of all that now have I made an end!”</p>
