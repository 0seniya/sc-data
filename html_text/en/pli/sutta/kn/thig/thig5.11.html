Men in their prime with pestle and with quern<br>
Are busied pounding rice and grinding corn.<br>
Men in their prime gather and heap up wealth,<br>
To have and nourish wife and children dear.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="vns" id="vns118"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp118"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_170"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv118"></a>But ye, my sisters, see ye carry out<br>
The Buddha’s will, which bringeth no remorse.<br>
Swiftly bathe ye your feet, then sit ye down<br>
Apart; your souls surrender utterly<br>
To spiritual calm—so do his will.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="vns" id="vns119"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp119"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_171"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv119"></a>Those Bhikkhunīs.<br>
The will of her who spake—Paṭācārā—<br>
The thirty Sisters heard and swift obeyed.<br>
Bathing their feet, they sat them down apart,<br>
And gave their souls to spiritual calm,<br>
Fulfilling thus the bidding of the Lord.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="vns" id="vns120"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp120"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_172"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv120"></a>While passed the first watch of the night, there rose<br>
Long memories of the bygone line of lives;<br>
While passed the second watch, the Heavenly Eye,<br>
Purview celestial, they clarified;<br>
While passed the last watch of the night, they burst<br>
And rent aside the gloom of ignorance.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="vns" id="vns121"></a><a class="vnp" id="vnp121"></a><a class="ms" id="p_19Th2_173"></a><a class="msdiv" id="msdiv121"></a>Then rising to their feet they hailed her blest:<br>
‘Fulfillèd is thy will! and thee we take,<br>
And like to Sakka o’er the thrice ten gods,<br>
Chieftain unconquered in celestial wars,<br>
We place thee as our Chief, and so shall live.<br>
The threefold Wisdom have we gotten now.<br>
From deadly drugs our souls are purified.’”</p>
