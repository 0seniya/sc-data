<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1707"></a> Back then I was the king of gods,<br>
known by the name of Varuṇa.<br>
I attended the Sambuddha,<br>
as his vehicle of power. <a class="vjw" id="vjw1"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1708"></a> When Atthadassi, the Best Man,<br>
Lord of the World, reached nirvana,<br>
supplying all the <i lang="pli">turiyas</i>,<br>
I went to the best Bodhi <span class="add">tree</span>. <a class="vjw" id="vjw2"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1709"></a> As though facing the Sambuddha<br>
I attended on the best Bodhi,<br>
with music and with dances <span class="add">too,</span><br>
well-accompanied by cymbals. <a class="vjw" id="vjw3"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1710"></a> After having served that Bodhi<br>
tree growing up from the earth <span class="add">there</span>,<br>
having eaten, with <span class="add">my</span> legs crossed,<br>
I passed away <span class="add">right</span> on the spot. <a class="vjw" id="vjw4"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1711"></a> Delighting in <span class="add">my</span> own karma,<br>
pleased in that superb Bodhi <span class="add">tree</span>,<br>
due to that pleasure in <span class="add">my</span> heart,<br>
I have achieved nirvana <span class="add">now</span>. <a class="vjw" id="vjw5"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1712"></a> <span class="add">And</span> sixty thousand instruments<br>
are attending me all the time<br>
as I move on from birth to birth<br>
among humans and also gods. <a class="vjw" id="vjw6"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1713"></a> The three fires are blown out in me;<br>
all <span class="add">new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
I am bearing my last body<br>
in the Buddha’s dispensation. <a class="vjw" id="vjw7"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1714"></a> In the five hundredth aeon hence<br>
there were thirty-four kṣatriyans<br>
<span class="add">all of whom</span> were named Subahū,<br>
possessors of the seven gems. <a class="vjw" id="vjw8"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw1715"></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw9"></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Ekāsaniya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
<p class="endsutta">The legend of Ekāsaniya Thera is finished.</p>
