<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2396"></a> I gave a heated room <span class="add">back then</span><br>
to Vipassi, the Blessed One,<br>
and a residence for the ill<br>
which was furnished with hot water. <a class="vjw" id="vjw1"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2397"></a> As a result of that good deed,<br>
my own state of being is good.<br>
I have come to know no illness:<br>
that is the fruit of good karma. <a class="vjw" id="vjw2"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2398"></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I donated that heated room,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of a heated room. <a class="vjw" id="vjw3"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2399"></a> In the seventh aeon ago<br>
there was one Aparājita,<br>
a wheel-turning king with great strength,<br>
possessor of the seven gems. <a class="vjw" id="vjw4"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2400"></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw5"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus indeed Venerable Avyādhika Thera spoke these verses.</p>
<p class="endsutta">The legend of Avyādhika Thera is finished.</p>
