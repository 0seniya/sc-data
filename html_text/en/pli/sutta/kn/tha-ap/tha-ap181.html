<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2142"></a>
In the city, Bandhumatī,<br>
I was a well-trained physician,<br>
bringing many folks happiness<br>
when patients suffered great <span class="add">illness</span>. <a class="vjw" id="vjw1"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2143"></a>
Having seen a monk who was sick,<br>
<span class="add">but</span> moral <span class="add">as too</span> very bright,<br>
with a pleased heart <span class="add">and</span> happy mind,<br>
I gave <span class="add">him some</span> medicine then. <a class="vjw" id="vjw2"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2144"></a>
That monk with well-guarded senses<br>
became healthy because of that.<br>
He was Vipassi’s attendant,<br>
known by the name of Asoka. <a class="vjw" id="vjw3"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2145"></a>
In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I gave <span class="add">him</span> medicinal herbs,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of medicine. <a class="vjw" id="vjw4"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2146"></a>
In the eighth aeon after that<br>
the one known as Sabbosadha<br>
was a wheel-turner with great strength,<br>
possessor of the seven gems. <a class="vjw" id="vjw5"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2147"></a>
The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw6"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus indeed Venerable Tikicchaka Thera spoke these verses.</p>
