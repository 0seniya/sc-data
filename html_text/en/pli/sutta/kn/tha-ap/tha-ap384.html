<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3284"></a> In the city, Bandhumatī,<br>
I worked in a hermitage then.<br>
I saw the Buddha, Spotless One,<br>
<span class="add">who</span> was traveling through the sky. <a class="vjw" id="vjw1"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3285"></a> Taking fruit of a breadfruit <span class="add">tree</span><br>
I gave <span class="add">it</span> to the Best Buddha.<br>
Standing in the sky, the Calm One,<br>
the Great Famed One accepted <span class="add">it</span>. <a class="vjw" id="vjw2"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3286-3287"></a>Having given Buddha that fruit,<br>
with a mind that was very clear,<br>
productive of delight for me,<br>
bringing happiness in this world,<br>
I then came to possess great joy<br>
and vast, ultimate happiness.<br>
A gem was truly produced for<br>
<span class="add">me,</span> being reborn here and there. <a class="vjw" id="vjw3-4"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3288"></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I gave <span class="add">the Buddha</span> fruit back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class="vjw" id="vjw5"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3289"></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw6"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3290"></a> My defilements are <span class="add">now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class="add">new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class="vjw" id="vjw7"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3291"></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw8"></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Labujaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.</p>
