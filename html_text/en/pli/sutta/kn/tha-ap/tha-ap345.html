<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3093"></a> The Teacher <span class="add">then</span> was named Tissa,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men.<br>
Having seen his passing away,<br>
I hoisted a flag <span class="add">at that place</span>. <a class="vjw" id="vjw1"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3094"></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class="add">firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class="add">my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class="add">then</span>. <a class="vjw" id="vjw2"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3095"></a> And <span class="add">afterwards,</span> three hundred times,<br>
I ruled over the <span class="add">world of</span> gods.<br>
And <span class="add">furthermore</span> five hundred times<br>
I was a king who turned the wheel. <a class="vjw" id="vjw3"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3096"></a> There was <span class="add">also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
I experienced own-karma,<br>
formerly well done by myself. <a class="vjw" id="vjw4"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3097"></a> In the ninety-two aeons since<br>
I did that <span class="add">good</span> karma back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving a flag. <a class="vjw" id="vjw5"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3098"></a> Today, if I should wish for <span class="add">it</span>,<br>
<span class="add">the world</span> with forests and mountains<br>
is covered by a <i lang="pli">khoma</i> cloth:<br>
the fruit ofwhat I did back then. <a class="vjw" id="vjw6"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw3099"></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw7"></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Dhajadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.</p>
