<h1>1.2 Pig’s Mouth</h1>
</div>

<p><span class="speaker">Narada Bhante:</span></p>

<p>Your body is the color of gold and shines in all directions. But your mouth is like a pig’s. What have you done in your previous life?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ghost:</span></p>

<p>I did nothing wrong with my body, but I said bad things using my mouth. That is why my body is beautiful but my mouth is like a pig’s, Narada Bhante.</p>

<p>So Bhante, Now that you can see my body, I strongly encourage you not to do bad things using your mouth, or you will also have the mouth of a pig and suffer like me.</p>
