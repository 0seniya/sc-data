<h1>5.1 Frog-Deva’s Mansion</h1>
</div>
<p><span class="speaker">Supreme Buddha:</span></p>
<p>Dear Deva, you are very mighty with many psychic powers. Your beautiful body shines in all directions. Now you are honoring my feet. Who are you?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Devata:</span></p>
<p>In my previous life, I was a frog living in a lake. One day I was listening to you preach. At that time a boy who was looking after cows while listening to you preach, accidentally killed me.</p>
<p>For just a brief moment, my mind was very pleased in hearing your voice. But now look at my psychic powers, fame, and beautiful body that I have earned from that very small act of merit.</p>
<p>Oh Gautama Buddha, those people who have been listening to your Dhamma for a long time will attain the fruit of the path where they escape from sorrow.</p>
