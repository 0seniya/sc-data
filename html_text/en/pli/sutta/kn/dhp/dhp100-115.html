<h1>The Thousands</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp100" id="100"></a>Better than a thousand useless words is one useful word, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp101" id="101"></a>Better than a thousand useless verses is one useful verse, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp102" id="102"></a>Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp103" id="103"></a>Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp104" id="104"></a><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp105" id="105"></a>Self-conquest is far better than the conquest of others. Not even a god, an angel, Mara or Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is self-subdued and ever restrained in conduct.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp106" id="106"></a>Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp107" id="107"></a>Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds, that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp108" id="108"></a>Whatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year, all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones, which is truly excellent.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp109" id="109"></a>To one ever eager to revere and serve the elders, these four blessing accrue: long life and beauty, happiness and power.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp110" id="110"></a>Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp111" id="111"></a>Better it is to live one day wise and meditative than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolled.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp112" id="112"></a>Better it is to live one day strenuous and resolute than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipated.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp113" id="113"></a>Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp114" id="114"></a>Better it is to live one day seeing the Deathless than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Deathless.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp115" id="115"></a>Better it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme Truth.</p>
