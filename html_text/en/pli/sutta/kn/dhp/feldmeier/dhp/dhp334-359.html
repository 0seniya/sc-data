</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc334' data-uid='dhp334'></a>The craving of the careless one grows like a creeper.<br>
The craver jumps from existence to existence,<br>
Like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc335' data-uid='dhp335'></a>One who is conquered by this miserable craving,<br>
This clinging in the world:<br>
His sorrows grow like bīraṇa grass after rain.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc336' data-uid='dhp336'></a>But one who conquers this miserable craving,<br>
So difficult to overcome in the world:<br>
His sorrows fall away, like drops of water from a<br>
lotus.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc337' data-uid='dhp337'></a>I say to you: Good fortune to all assembled here!<br>
Uproot the root of craving,<br>
As one would who desires the fragrant root of the<br>
bīraṇa grass.<br>
Let not Māra crush you, as a torrent crushes a reed,<br>
Again and again and again.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc338' data-uid='dhp338'></a>Just as a tree cut down will grow again<br>
When the root remains healthy and strong,<br>
So this suffering arises again and again<br>
When dormant craving is not destroyed.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc339' data-uid='dhp339'></a>The wrong-viewed person,<br>
The one in whom the thirty-six streams of craving<br>
flow mightily,<br>
Is carried away by these currents,<br>
These thoughts dependent on passion.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc340' data-uid='dhp340'></a>Streams flow everywhere.<br>
The creeper, having sprung up, establishes itself.<br>
Seeing that the creeper has emerged,<br>
Use wisdom to cut it off at the root.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc341' data-uid='dhp341'></a>Delights, flowing along and filled with lust, arise in<br>
people.<br>
Surely, those intent on enjoyment, seeking pleasure,<br>
Undergo birth and old age.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc342' data-uid='dhp342'></a>Encircled by craving,<br>
People run around like ensnared hares.<br>
Bound by the fetters of attachment.<br>
They undergo long suffering again and again.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc343' data-uid='dhp343'></a>Encircled by craving,<br>
People run around like ensnared hares.<br>
Therefore, one who desires dispassion<br>
Should dispel craving.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc344' data-uid='dhp344'></a>Who, for the sake of being free from the forest (of<br>
craving), Is resolved upon the forest (of solitude), And then runs back to the forest (of craving); Come and see one freed who runs back into<br>
bondage!<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc345' data-uid='dhp345'></a>The fetter made of iron, of wood, or of babbaja grass,<br>
Is not so strong, say the wise.<br>
But infatuation with jewels and ornaments,<br>
Or longing for sons and wives,<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc346' data-uid='dhp346'></a>That is a strong bond, say the wise,<br>
Loose, yet difficult to be freed from.<br>
When the bond is cut, they go about,<br>
Free from longing,<br>
Having abandoned sensual pleasure.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc347' data-uid='dhp347'></a>Those excited by passion fall into the current,<br>
As a spider caught in its self-made web.<br>
Having cut off this passion, the wise set forth,<br>
Free from longing,<br>
Having abandoned all suffering.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc348' data-uid='dhp348'></a>Let go of the past, let go of the future, let go of the<br>
present.<br>
Gone to the other shore of existence,<br>
With mind everywhere emancipated,<br>
You will not again come to birth and old age.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc349' data-uid='dhp349'></a>For the one with disturbed thoughts and intense<br>
passion,<br>
Who is focused on pleasant things,<br>
Craving only grows stronger.<br>
Indeed, craving fortifies the fetter.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc350' data-uid='dhp350'></a>For the one devoted to calming thoughts, always<br>
mindful,<br>
Who meditates on what is foul:<br>
That one will make an end and cut off Māra’s bond.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc351' data-uid='dhp351'></a>One who has attained perfection,<br>
Who is pure, without craving or fear:<br>
This one has destroyed the arrows of becoming;<br>
His present body, the last.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc352' data-uid='dhp352'></a>One who is without craving, free of grasping,<br>
Skilled in the scriptures, who would know their<br>
arrangement;<br>
Such a one is truly called great person;<br>
Such a one possesses great wisdom;<br>
Such a one is living his final life.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc353' data-uid='dhp353'></a>I know all; I overcome all.<br>
Free of stain in all conditions,<br>
Abandoning everything,<br>
Emancipated by the dissolution of craving,<br>
I have understood everything on my own.<br></p>
To whom should I point (as teacher)?
<p><a class='sc' id='sc354' data-uid='dhp354'></a>The gift of Dhamma overwhelms all gifts.<br>
The taste of Dhamma overwhelms all tastes.<br>
The delight of Dhamma overwhelms all delights.<br>
The dissolution of craving overwhelms all suffering.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc355' data-uid='dhp355'></a>Wealth wounds those lacking wisdom,<br>
Not those seeking the other shore.<br>
Craving wealth, those who lack wisdom<br>
Destroy others, even as themselves.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc356' data-uid='dhp356'></a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by passions.<br>
But indeed what is given to those whose passions are<br>
gone<br>
Bears great fruit.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc357' data-uid='dhp357'></a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by ill will.<br>
But indeed what is given to those whose ill will is<br>
gone<br>
Bears great fruit.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc358' data-uid='dhp358'></a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by delusion.<br>
But indeed what is given to those whose delusion is<br>
gone<br>
Bears great fruit.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc359' data-uid='dhp359'></a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by longing.<br>
Truly, what is given to those whose longing is gone<br>
Bears great fruit.<br></p>
