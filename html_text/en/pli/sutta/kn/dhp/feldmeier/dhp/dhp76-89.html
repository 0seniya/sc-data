<p><a class='sc' id='sc76' data-uid='dhp76'></a>One ought to regard another who sees one’s faults,<br>
And censures what should be censured,<br>
As a revealer of treasures.<br>
One should associate with such an intelligent and<br>
wise person,<br>
For such company is always for the better.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc77' data-uid='dhp77'></a>He who would counsel, instruct,<br>
And restrain another from base behavior<br>
Is dear to the good, but displeasing to the bad.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc78' data-uid='dhp78'></a>Do not associate with bad friends.<br>
Do not associate with depraved people.<br>
Associate with virtuous friends.<br>
Associate with the best of people.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc79' data-uid='dhp79'></a>One who drinks in the Dhamma sleeps happily<br>
With a clear mind.<br>
The wise one ever-delights in the Dhamma<br>
Proclaimed by the noble ones.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc80' data-uid='dhp80'></a>Irrigators guide water,<br>
Fletchers straighten the shaft,<br>
Carpenters bend wood,<br>
The wise master themselves.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc81' data-uid='dhp81'></a>Just as a solid rock is unmoved by the wind,<br>
So the wise are unmoved by blame or praise.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc82' data-uid='dhp82'></a>Just as a deep lake is clear and undisturbed,<br>
So the wise become clear,<br>
Having heard the teachings.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc83' data-uid='dhp83'></a>The good are not pleasure-lovers who seek idle<br>
chatter;<br>
Always, they are detached.<br>
Though touched by comfort and then by affliction,<br>
The wise manifest no elation or depression.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc84' data-uid='dhp84'></a>One who would not want, for the sake of oneself or<br>
another,<br>
A son, wealth, a kingdom, or unjust success;<br>
This is one who is virtuous, wise, and righteous.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc85' data-uid='dhp85'></a>Few are those who have gone to the other shore;<br>
Many are those who run about on this side.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc86' data-uid='dhp86'></a>But those who live according to the well-taught<br>
Dhamma<br>
Will go beyond the realm of death, so difficult to<br>
cross.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc87' data-uid='dhp87'></a>Having abandoned the dark state,<br>
The wise one cultivates the light;<br>
Having gone from home to homelessness,<br>
He enters solitude, so difficult to enjoy.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc88' data-uid='dhp88'></a>Owning nothing, having abandoned sense pleasures,<br>
Having cleansed himself from mental defilements,<br>
There, let the wise one wish for delight.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc89' data-uid='dhp89'></a>Those who have minds well-developed in the means<br>
of awakening,<br>
Who, having removed the toxins, delight in<br>
renouncing attachments:<br>
They are radiant and completely emancipated in<br>
this world.<br></p>
