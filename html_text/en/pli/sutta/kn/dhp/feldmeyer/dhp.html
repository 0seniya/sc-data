<p><a class='sc' id='sc1' data-uid='dhp1'></a>All phenomena are preceded by the mind,<br>
Created by the mind,<br>
And have the mind as their master.<br>

Suffering follows as the cart-wheel follows the ox’s<br>
foot.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2' data-uid='dhp2'></a>All phenomena are preceded by the mind,<br>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc4' data-uid='dhp4'></a>He insulted me; he struck me;<br>
He defeated me; he robbed me.<br>
For those who do not dwell on such resentments,<br>
Enmity subsides;<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5' data-uid='dhp5'></a>For enmities are never appeased by enmity.<br>
They are appeased by peace.<br>
This is an eternal law.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6' data-uid='dhp6'></a>But many do not realize that we all must die.<br>
Those who do realize this appease their quarrels.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7' data-uid='dhp7'></a>One who lives unrestrained in the senses<br>
And focused on pleasant things,<br>
Who is immoderate in food,<br>
Who is listless and lazy:<br>
Māra overcomes him,<br>
Just as wind overcomes a weak tree.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8' data-uid='dhp8'></a>One who lives restrained in the senses<br>
And focused on unpleasant things,<br>
Who is moderate in food,<br>
Who has faith and diligence:<br>
Māra cannot overcome him,<br>
Just as wind cannot overcome a rocky mountain.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9' data-uid='dhp9'></a>Whoever would take on the yellow robe,<br>
While hampered by defilement,<br>
Being unrestrained and without truth,<br>
Is unworthy of that yellow robe.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10' data-uid='dhp10'></a>Whoever has thrown off defilement,<br>
Is well-established in virtue,<br>
And is possessed with self-control and truth,<br>
Is truly worthy of the yellow robe.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11' data-uid='dhp11'></a>Those who deem the worthless as valuable,<br>
And see the valuable as worthless:<br>
They do not attain the valuable;<br>
They roam in the field of wrong thought.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12' data-uid='dhp12'></a>(But) those who have known the valuable as valuable<br>
And see the worthless as worthless:<br>
They attain the valuable;<br>
They roam in the field of right thought.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13' data-uid='dhp13'></a>Just as rain penetrates a poorly thatched house,<br>
So passion penetrates an uncultivated mind.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14' data-uid='dhp14'></a>Just as rain does not penetrate a well-thatched house,<br>
So passion fails to penetrate a well-cultivated mind.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15' data-uid='dhp15'></a>Here he grieves, following death he grieves;<br>
In both states the evil-doer grieves.<br>
He grieves, he is afflicted,<br>
Having seen his defiled deeds.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16' data-uid='dhp16'></a>Here he rejoices, following death he rejoices;<br>
In both states he who has done good deeds rejoices.<br>
He rejoices, he delights,<br>
Having seen his pure deeds.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17' data-uid='dhp17'></a>Here he is tormented, following death he is<br>
tormented;<br>
In both states the evil-doer is tormented.<br>
He is tormented knowing, “I have done evil.” Reborn to a miserable state, he is tormented all the<br>
more.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18' data-uid='dhp18'></a>Here he rejoices, following death he rejoices;<br>
In both states he who has done good deeds rejoices.<br>
He rejoices knowing, “I have done good deeds.” Reborn to a blissful state, he rejoices all the more.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19' data-uid='dhp19'></a>One who recites much scripture,<br>
But, being negligent, does not act accordingly,<br>
Is like a cowherd counting others’ cows,<br>
Having no share in the fruits of monastic life.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20' data-uid='dhp20'></a>One who recites little scripture,<br>

Having right knowledge and a well-emancipated<br>
mind,<br>
Not clinging in this world or the next:<br>
He truly shares the fruits of monastic life.<br></p>

<h2 class='sutta'>Vigilance</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21' data-uid='dhp21'></a>Vigilance is the path to the deathless state.<br>
Negligence is the path to death.<br>
The vigilant do not die;<br>
The negligent are as if already dead.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc22' data-uid='dhp22'></a>Knowing this distinction,<br>
Those wise in vigilance rejoice therein,<br>
Delighting in the field of the noble ones.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc23' data-uid='dhp23'></a>Absorbed in meditation,<br>
with perseverance and constant effort,<br>
The wise touch Nibbāna,<br>
that ultimate shelter from bondage.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc24' data-uid='dhp24'></a>For one who is vigilant and restrained,<br>
Who is energetic and mindful,<br>
Who acts carefully and purely,<br>
Who lives the Dhamma,<br>
Fame grows.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc25' data-uid='dhp25'></a>Through effort, vigilance, restraint, and self-<br>
control,<br>
The wise one makes himself an island that a flood<br>
could not overwhelm.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc26' data-uid='dhp26'></a>The ignorant and foolish give themselves to<br>
negligence,<br>
While the wise protect vigilance as the supreme<br>
treasure.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc27' data-uid='dhp27'></a>Do not give yourself to negligence<br>
Or be intimate with sensual pleasure.<br>
Being meditative and vigilant,<br>
One attains great happiness.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc28' data-uid='dhp28'></a>When the wise one expels negligence by vigilance,<br>
Having ascended to the stronghold of wisdom,<br>
And free from sorrow,<br>
He observes the sorrowing crowd,<br>
As a sage, standing on a mountain,<br>
Observes fools on the plain.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc29' data-uid='dhp29'></a>Vigilant among the negligent,<br>
Wide awake among the sleeping,<br>
The deeply wise one goes forth,<br>
Like a swift horse who leaves the nag behind.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc30' data-uid='dhp30'></a>By vigilance,<br>
Indra went to the highest seat among the gods.<br>
Vigilance they praise; negligence is ever-derided.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc31' data-uid='dhp31'></a>The monk, devoted to vigilance and seeing the<br>
danger in negligence,<br>
Goes forth like a fire burning every fetter,<br>
gross and subtle.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc32' data-uid='dhp32'></a>The monk, devoted to vigilance and seeing the<br>
danger in negligence,<br>
Is close to Nibbāna and cannot regress.<br></p>

<h2 class='sutta'>The Mind</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc33' data-uid='dhp33'></a>The mind is wavering and unsteady,<br>
Difficult to guard, hard to restrain.<br>
The wise one sets it straight,<br>
As a fletcher straightens the arrow’s shaft.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc34' data-uid='dhp34'></a>Like a fish thrown on land from its home in the<br>
water,<br>
This mind thrashes to escape Māra’s realm.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc35' data-uid='dhp35'></a>Good is the taming of the mind,<br>
So difficult to control, so swift,<br>
Jumping toward what it desires.<br>
The tamed mind brings happiness.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc36' data-uid='dhp36'></a>The wise should guard the mind,<br>
So difficult to perceive, so subtle,<br>
Jumping at what it desires.<br>
The protected mind brings happiness.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc37' data-uid='dhp37'></a>The mind wanders far and alone,<br>
Incorporeal and resting in the cavern (of the body). Those who restrain it will be released from Māra’s<br>
bonds.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc38' data-uid='dhp38'></a>Wisdom does not mature in one of unsteady mind<br>
And drifting faith,<br>
Who knows not the true Dhamma.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc39' data-uid='dhp39'></a>For the one who is awake,<br>
Whose mind is neither afflicted nor filled with desire,<br>
Who has transcended merit and demerit,<br>
There is no fear.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc40' data-uid='dhp40'></a>Having understood this body as a clay pot,<br>
Having established this mind as a fortress,<br>
One should battle Māra with the sword of wisdom,<br>
And protect what has been conquered, clinging to<br>
nothing.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc41' data-uid='dhp41'></a>Soon indeed, this body will lie on the earth,<br>
Without consciousness,<br>
Cast away as a worthless log.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc42' data-uid='dhp42'></a>Whatever an enemy would do to an enemy,<br>
A hater to one hated,<br>
Worse than that is the harm that a wrongly directed<br>
mind can do to itself.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc43' data-uid='dhp43'></a>Whatever mother, father, or other relative may do,<br>
Better still, the good that a well-directed mind can<br>
do for itself.<br></p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc45' data-uid='dhp45'></a>The disciple will conquer this earth,<br>
The worlds of Yama, and those of the gods.<br>
The disciple will select the well-taught Dhamma<br>

As an expert gardener selects a flower.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc46' data-uid='dhp46'></a>Knowing this body to be like foam,<br>
Realizing its mirage-like nature,<br>
Cutting off the flowers of Māra,<br>
One may go unseen by the King of Death.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc47' data-uid='dhp47'></a>The one with a clinging mind,<br>
Who is just gathering flowers,<br>
Is carried away by death,<br>
As a sleeping village is carried away by a great flood.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc48' data-uid='dhp48'></a>The one with a clinging mind,<br>
Who is only gathering flowers,<br>
Is overpowered by death.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc49' data-uid='dhp49'></a>As a bee departing the flower,<br>
Having taken its nectar,<br>
Does no harm to its color or fragrance,<br>
So should a sage go through a village.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc50' data-uid='dhp50'></a>Do not attend to others’ wrong doings,<br>
What they have done or failed to do.<br>
Attend only to yourself,<br>
And what you have done and failed to do.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc51' data-uid='dhp51'></a>Like a beautiful flower<br>
That is full of color but lacking fragrance,<br>
So too are well-said words,<br>
Fruitless when not lived.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc52' data-uid='dhp52'></a>Like a beautiful flower<br>
That is full of color and fragrant,<br>
So too are well-said words,<br>
Fruitful when lived.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc53' data-uid='dhp53'></a>As many garland strands could be made from a heap<br>
of flowers,<br>
So should one born mortal do much good.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc54' data-uid='dhp54'></a>Neither the fragrance of the flower,<br>
Nor that of sandalwood, tagara, or jasmine,<br>
Can go against the wind,<br>
But the fragrance of the good does go against the<br>
wind;<br>
It pervades all directions.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc55' data-uid='dhp55'></a>Sandalwood, tagara, jasmine, and lotus,<br>
Among these perfumes the fragrance of virtue is<br>
unbounded.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc56' data-uid='dhp56'></a>Faint is this fragrance of tagara and sandalwood,<br>
But the scent of the virtuous one blows supreme;<br>
It wafts even among the gods.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc57' data-uid='dhp57'></a>Māra does not find the tracks of those<br>
Consummate in virtue,<br>
Who dwell in vigilance,<br>
And are freed by perfect knowledge.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc58' data-uid='dhp58'></a>Just as from a rubbish heap on the roadside,<br>
A lotus flower, so pure of smell and pleasing to the<br>
mind, can grow;<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc59' data-uid='dhp59'></a>So in the midst of the rubbish heap of blind,<br>

A disciple of the Fully Awakened One shines<br>
radiantly with wisdom.<br></p>

Long is a trek for the weary,<br>
Long is samsara for fools,<br>
Who do not understand the true Dhamma.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc61' data-uid='dhp61'></a>If a traveler should not find another better or equal<br>

Then he should resolutely travel alone.<br>
With fools there is no companionship.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc62' data-uid='dhp62'></a>The fool worries: “I have sons, I have wealth.” He does not even possess himself.<br>
How then sons? How then wealth?<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc63' data-uid='dhp63'></a>A fool who considers himself foolish is,<br>
In this, like a sage.<br>
But a fool who is proud of his cleverness<br>
Is truly called fool.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc64' data-uid='dhp64'></a>A fool who spends a lifetime attending on a sage,<br>
Will not apprehend the Dhamma,<br>
Just as a spoon can never know the soup’s flavor.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc65' data-uid='dhp65'></a>An intelligent person who attends on a sage,<br>
Even for a moment,<br>

Doing evil deeds that bear bitter fruit.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc67' data-uid='dhp67'></a>That deed is not well-done,<br>
Which one regrets when accomplished,<br>
Which results in crying and a tear-streaked face.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc68' data-uid='dhp68'></a>That deed is well-done,<br>
Which one does not regret when accomplished,<br>
Which results in delight and joy.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc69' data-uid='dhp69'></a>As long as evil has not ripened,<br>
The fool thinks it honey;<br>
When evil ripens, the fool suffers.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc70' data-uid='dhp70'></a>Though month after month<br>
He may eat his food with the tip of the grass blade,<br>
The fool is not worth a fraction<br>
Of one who has realized the Dhamma.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc71' data-uid='dhp71'></a>Indeed, like fresh milk,<br>
An evil deed does not immediately curdle.<br>
Burning, it follows the fool,<br>
Like a fire concealed by ashes.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc72' data-uid='dhp72'></a>Only to his detriment does knowledge arise in the<br>
fool.<br>
It destroys his good fortune and splits his head.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc73' data-uid='dhp73'></a>He seeks undue respect, honor among monks,<br>
Authority in monasteries, and devotion by families<br>
not his own.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc74' data-uid='dhp74'></a>“Let both householder and monk think that alone I have done this,<br>
Let them be under my will in every task.” So thinks the fool, whose desire and pride grow.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc75' data-uid='dhp75'></a>There is one path to worldly gains,<br>
And a very different path to Nibbāna.<br>
Let the monk who knows this,<br>
The disciple of the Awakened One,<br>
Not rejoice in honor, but cultivate solitude.<br></p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc423' data-uid='dhp423'></a>The one who knows his former lives,<br>
And sees the heavens and hells,<br>
Who has attained the end of birth,<br>
And obtained the higher knowledge,<br>
The sage who has achieved all accomplishments:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.<br></p>
