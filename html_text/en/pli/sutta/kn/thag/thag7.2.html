<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a><a class="vns" id="vns466"></a>Bhaddiya has plucked out craving, root and all,<br>
And in a jungle thicket<br>
On the far side of Ambāṭaka park,<br>
He practices <i>jhāna</i>; he is truly well-favoured.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc2"></a><a class="vns" id="vns467"></a>Some delight in drums,<br>
In lutes, and in cymbals;<br>
But here, at the foot of a tree,<br>
I delight in the Buddha’s teaching.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc3"></a><a class="vns" id="vns468"></a>If the Buddha were to grant me one wish,<br>
And I were to get what I wished for,<br>
I’d choose that the whole world<br>
Be always mindful of the body.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc4"></a><a class="vns" id="vns469"></a>Those who’ve judged me by my appearance,<br>
And those who’ve followed me because of my voice,<br>
They’re under the sway of desire and lust;<br>
They don’t know me.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc5"></a><a class="vns" id="vns470"></a>Not knowing what’s inside,<br>
Not seeing what’s outside;<br>
The fool, obstructed all around,<br>
Is carried away by my voice.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc6"></a><a class="vns" id="vns471"></a>Not knowing what’s inside,<br>
But discerning what’s outside;<br>
They too, seeing only the external fruits of practice,<br>
Are carried away by my voice.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc7"></a><a class="vns" id="vns472"></a>Understanding what’s inside,<br>
And discerning what’s outside;<br>
They, seeing without obstacles,<br>
Are not carried away by my voice.</p>

<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book" translate="no">Elders’s Verses I</cite translate="no">, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>
