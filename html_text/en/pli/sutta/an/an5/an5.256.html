<h1>256. Stinginess</h1>
</div>

<p>“Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the first jhana. Which five? Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to one’s family [of supporters], stinginess as to one’s gains, stinginess as to one’s status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma. Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the first jhana.</p>
<p>“With the abandoning of these five qualities, one is capable of entering & remaining in the first jhana. Which five? Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings]… one’s family [of supporters]… one’s gains… one’s status, and stinginess as to the Dhamma. With the abandoning of these five qualities, one is capable of entering & remaining in the first jhana.”</p>
