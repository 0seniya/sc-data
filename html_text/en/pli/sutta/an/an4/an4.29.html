<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four Dhamma factors, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. What four?</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc2"></a>(1) “Non-longing is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which is not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which is not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. (2) Good will is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing … (3) Right mindfulness is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing … (4) Right concentration is a Dhamma factor, primal, of long standing … not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc3"></a>“These are the four Dhamma factors, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, which are not being adulterated and will not be adulterated, which are not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins.”</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="sc4"></a>One should dwell free from longing<br>
with a heart of good will.<br>
One should be mindful and one-pointed in mind,<br>
internally well concentrated.<br></p>
