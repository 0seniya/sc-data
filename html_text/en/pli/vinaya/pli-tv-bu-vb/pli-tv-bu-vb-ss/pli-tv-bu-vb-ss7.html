<h1>7. The training rule on building dwellings</h1>
</header>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli3.156' href='#pts-vp-pli3.156'>PTS vp Pali 3.156</a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='bu-ss.7.1' href='#bu-ss.7.1'>bu-ss.7.1</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1512' href='#msdiv1512'>Msdiv 1512</a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery. At that time a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him, “Venerable, please find a site for a dwelling, and I’ll have one built for you.”</p>
<p>While Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling, he had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom. People grumbled and complained, “How can the Sakyan ascetics have such a tree felled? They are hurting life with one faculty.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1513' href='#msdiv1513'>Msdiv 1513</a> The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires …<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.267' href='#bd.1.267'>BD 1.267</a> complained and criticized Venerable Channa in the same manner.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1514' href='#msdiv1514'>Msdiv 1514</a> After criticizing Venerable Channa in various ways, they informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, Channa, that you had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how can you do such a thing? People perceive trees as living beings. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><span class='rule'><span class='note' hidden=''>I have rendered <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sassāmikaṃ</i> as “with a sponsoring owner.” The word <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sāmika</i> generally means “owner,” and there seems to be no reason why that should not also be the meaning here. However, although the monk does not own the dwelling, he is still the builder and the intended user once the building is finished. To indicate this, I have added the word “sponsoring.”</span> ‘When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, he must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides. If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</span></p>
