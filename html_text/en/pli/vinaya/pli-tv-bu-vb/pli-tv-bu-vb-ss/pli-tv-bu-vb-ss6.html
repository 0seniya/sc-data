<h1>6. The training rule on building huts</h1>
</header>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli3.145' href='#pts-vp-pli3.145'>PTS vp Pali 3.145</a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='bu-ss.6.1.1' href='#bu-ss.6.1.1'>bu-ss.6.1.1</a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time the monks of Āḷavī were building huts by means of begging. The huts were intended for themselves, did not have a sponsoring owner, and were inappropriate in size. Moreover, they were never finished, and so the monks kept on asking and begging,<span class='note' hidden=''>I have rendered <i lang='pli' translate='no'>muñja</i>-reed and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pabbaja</i>-reed with the single word “reed.” I am not aware that these two types of reed can be distinguished in English.</span> “Give a man, give a servant, give an ox, give a cart, give an adz, give a hatchet, give an ax, give a spade, give a chisel, give a creeper, give bamboo, give reed, give grass, give clay.” People felt oppressed by all the asking and begging, so much so that when they saw a monk they became alarmed and fearful, and they ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors. They even ran away when they saw cows, thinking they were monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.247' href='#bd.1.247'>BD 1.247</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1418' href='#msdiv1418'>Msdiv 1418</a> Just then Venerable Mahākassapa, after spending the rainy season at Rājagaha, set out for Āḷavī. When he eventually arrived in Āḷavī, he stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine. Then, after dressing one morning, Venerable Mahākassapa took his bowl and robe and entered Āḷavī for alms. When people saw him they became fearful and alarmed, and they ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors. After finishing his almsround and eating his meal, Venerable Mahākassapa returned and said to the monks:</p>
<p>“Āḷavī used to have plenty of food, and it wasn’t difficult to get by on almsfood. But now Āḷavī is short of almsfood, and it’s not easy to get by on alms. Why is that?”<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.248' href='#bd.1.248'>BD 1.248</a> The monks told Venerable Mahākassapa what had happened.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='bu-ss.6.1.2' href='#bu-ss.6.1.2'>bu-ss.6.1.2</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1419' href='#msdiv1419'>Msdiv 1419</a> Around the same time, after staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Master too set out for Āḷavī. When he eventually arrived at Āḷavī, he too stayed at the Aggāḷava shrine.</p>
<p>Venerable Mahākassapa approached the Master, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side. And he informed the Master of what had happened.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1420' href='#msdiv1420'>Msdiv 1420</a> The Master then had the Order of monks assembled and questioned the monks of Āḷavī, “Is it true, monks, that you’re building huts through begging, huts intended for yourself, without a sponsoring owner, and inappropriate in size? And that because they were never completed, you kept on asking and begging for all sorts of things, and people felt oppressed to point where they now avoid monks?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “… Foolish men, how can you act in this way? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …” After rebuking them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

He encircled him with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head. Because of his fear of that dragon, the younger sage became thin, haggard, and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs. The older sage saw him like this and asked him what was the matter. And the younger sage told him. The elder sage said, ‘Would you like that dragon not to return?’</p>
<p>‘I would.’</p>
<p>‘Well then, did you see anything belonging to that dragon?’</p>
<p>‘I saw a ornamental jewel on his neck.’</p>
<p>‘In that case ask the dragon for that jewel.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1422' href='#msdiv1422'>Msdiv 1422</a> Soon the dragon king again emerged from the Ganges, approached the younger sage, and stood to one side. The sage said to him, ‘Sir, give me the jewel; I want the jewel.’ And the dragon thought, ‘The monk is asking for the jewel,’ and he quickly departed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1423' href='#msdiv1423'>Msdiv 1423</a> Once more the dragon king emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage.<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.250' href='#bd.1.250'>BD 1.250</a> The sage saw him coming and said to him, ‘Sir, give me the jewel; I want the jewel.’ When the dragon heard him, he turned around right there.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1424' href='#msdiv1424'>Msdiv 1424</a> Yet again the dragon king emerged from the Ganges. The younger sage saw him emerging and said to him, ‘Sir, give me the jewel; I want the jewel.’ The dragon king then spoke these verses to the sage:</p>

<p>Because he did not get to see that beautiful dragon, the young sage became even thinner, more haggard and pale, his veins protruding even more. The older sage saw him like this and asked what was the matter. He replied, ‘It’s because I no longer get to see that beautiful dragon.’ The older sage then spoke to him in verse:</p>

Not far from that grove was an large, low-lying marsh. A great flock of birds fed in the marsh during the day and entered the grove to roost at night. The monk was disturbed by the noise of the flocking birds, and so he came to see me. He bowed down to me, sat down to one side, and I said to him, ‘I hope you’re keeping well, monk; I hope you’re comfortable. I hope you’re not tired from traveling. And where have you come from?’</p>
<p>‘I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir; I’m comfortable.<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.252' href='#bd.1.252'>BD 1.252</a> And I’m not tired from traveling. On the slopes of the Himalayas there’s a great forest grove and close by a large low-lying marsh. A large flock of birds feeds in that low-lying marsh during the day and comes at night to roost in that forest grove. That’s where I’ve come from, Master, and I left because I was disturbed by the noise of that flock of birds.’</p>
<p>‘Would you like that flock of birds not to return?’</p>
<p>‘I would, Master.’</p>
<p>‘Well then, go back to that forest grove. In the first watch of the night, call out three times, “Listen to me, good birds. From whoever roosts in this forest grove, I want a feather. Each one of you must give me a feather.” And in the second and third watch of the night do the same thing.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1431' href='#msdiv1431'>Msdiv 1431</a> The monk returned to that forest grove and did as instructed.

<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1437' href='#msdiv1437'>Msdiv 1437</a> <span class='rule'>‘When a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself,<span class='note' hidden=''>That is, twelve <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sugata-vidatthis</i> long and seven <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sugata-vidatthis</i> wide inside. A <i lang='pli' translate='no'>vidatthi</i> is often translated as a hand-span. <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Sugata</i> is an epithet of the Buddha, but in this context it quite possibly should be understood as referring to a standard, “the standard hand-span.” The commentary, <span class='ref'>Sp.3.567.21</span>, says that, “Here the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sugata vidatthi</i> is equal to three <i lang='pli' translate='no'>vidatthis</i> of an average man,” <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo</i>. This does not need to be understood as the Buddha being three times the size of an ordinary person, but just that the standard hand-span is three times the regular length. For the conversion into metric units I nevertheless follow the estimate of the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sugata-vidatthi</i> in BMC, pp.565-566. For an explanation of the rendering “sponsoring owner,” see note to the following rule, <span class='ref'>MS.1.1515</span>.</span> it is to be no more than 3 meters long and 1.75 meters wide inside. He must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides. If a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, or he exceeds the size limit, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</span></p>
