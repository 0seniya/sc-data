<h1>12. The training rule on being difficult to correct</h1>
</header>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.309' href='#bd.1.309'>BD 1.309</a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='bu-ss.12.1' href='#bu-ss.12.1'>bu-ss.12.1</a></p>
<p><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv1729' href='#msdiv1729'>Msdiv 1729</a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Channa was behaving improperly. The monks would tell him, “Don’t do that; it’s not allowable,” and he would reply, “Who are you to correct me? I should correct you! The Buddha is mine; the Teaching is mine. The Truth was realized by the young Master because of me. Just as a great wind lifts up grass, sticks, and fallen leaves all at once, just as a mountain stream lifts up the leaves of various water plants all at once, so too you–having various names, various families, various castes, various clans–having gone forth, have been lifted up together. So, who are you to correct me? I should correct you! The Buddha is mine; the Teaching is mine. The Truth was realized by the young Master because of me.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized him,<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.310' href='#bd.1.310'>BD 1.310</a> “How can Venerable Channa make himself incorrigible when he’s legitimately corrected by the monks?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli3.178' href='#pts-vp-pli3.178'>PTS vp Pali 3.178</a> They rebuked Venerable Channa in many ways and then informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, Channa, that you make yourself incorrigible when you’re legitimately corrected by the monks?</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him: “… Foolish man, how can you act in this way? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a> <span class='rule'>‘If a monk is difficult to correct, and he makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monks concerning the training rules that are recited, saying, “Venerables, don’t say anything to me, either positive or negative, and I won’t say anything to you, either positive or negative; please refrain from correcting me,” then the monks should correct him in this way: “Venerable, be easy to correct, not incorrigible.<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.311' href='#bd.1.311'>BD 1.311</a> And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you. For it’s in this way that the Master’s community has grown, that is, through mutual correction and mutual rehabilitation.” If that monk still continues as before, the monks should admonish him up to three times to make him stop. If he then stops, that is good. If not, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</span></p>

<div class='gloss'>
<p>Other monks, those who see it or hear about it. They should say, <span class='kamma'>“Venerable, be easy to correct, not incorrigible. And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you. For it’s in this way that the Master’s community has grown, that is, through mutual correction and mutual rehabilitation.” And they should say this a second and a third time.</span> If he stops, that is good.

<p>That monk, even if he has to be dragged into the middle of the Order of monks, should be spoken to thus: <span class='kamma'>“Venerable, be easy to correct, not incorrigible. And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you.
