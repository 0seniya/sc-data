<p class="pe"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="10.1"></a>By which five is consummation reached here?</p>
<p>The “stream-attainer” destined not to undergo more than seven births, the “stream-attainer” transmigrating through a few families (less than seven), the “single-seed” “stream-attainer”, the “once-returner”, and one attaining Arahantship in this very existence:—of these five, consummation is reached here.</p>
<p>By which five is consummation reached after leaving this world?</p>
<p>“One who dies and attains Nirvāṇa before half the age he should have lived in a Brahmanic world expire”, the “term-curtailing passer-away”, the “automatic passer-away”, “one attaining Nirvāṇa through strenuous exertion”, “one proceeding upstream to the Akaṇiṭṭha region”… By these five, consummation is reached after leaving this world. </p>
<p class="endsection">Thus far has been made the determination of human types.</p>
<p class="endsutta">Here ends the specification of grouping by Ten.</p>
<p class="endbook">Here ends the “Designation of Human Types”. </p>
