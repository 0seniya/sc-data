<p class="pe"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="6.1"></a>1. There is the person who, in regard to doctrines he has not heard of before, thoroughly understands by his own effort the truths, and obtains therein omniscience as well as mastery over the fruits.</p>
<p>Such an one is to be considered a perfectly Enlightened One.</p>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="6.2"></a>2. There is the person who, in regard to doctrines he has not heard of before, thoroughly understands by his own effort the truths, but does not obtain omniscience therein as well as mastery over the fruits.</p>
<p>Such an one is to be considered enlightened for himself (<i lang="pli">paccekasambuddho</i>).</p>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="6.3"></a>3. There is the person who, in regard to doctrines he has not heard of before, thoroughly understands by his own effort the truths, puts an end to suffering in this very existence, and attains the perfection of discipleship.</p>
<p>Such an one is to be considered a Sariputta and a Moggallāna.</p>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="6.4"></a>4. There is the person who, in regard to doctrines unheard of before, thoroughly understands by his own effort the truths, puts an end to suffering in this very existence, but does not attain the perfection of discipleship.</p>
<p>The other Arahants are to be so considered.</p>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="6.5"></a>5. There is the person who, in regard to doctrines unheard of before, thoroughly understands by his own effort the truths, puts an end to suffering in this very existence, and becomes a non-returner, not having [to] come back to these conditions.</p>
<p>The “non-returner” (<i lang="pli">anāgāmī</i>) is to be so considered.</p>
<p class="pe"><a class="pts-vp-en" id="6.6"></a>6. There is the person who, in regard to doctrines unheard of before, thoroughly understands by his own effort the truths, and (as he) does not put an end to suffering in this very existence, becomes a once-returner, having [to] come back to these conditions.</p>
<p>The stream-attainer (<i lang="pli">sotāpanna</i>) and the “once-returner” are to be so considered.</p>
