<h2>4. The Fourth Path</h2>
<p><strong><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs364' href='#pts-cs364'>PTS cs 364</a> Which are the states that are good?</strong></p>
<p>When he cultivates the Jhāna of the Supermundane (the rapt meditation), whereby there is a going forth and onward, making for the undoing of rebirth, and when, that he may attain the Fourth Stage, he has put away absolutely and entirely all passion for Form, all passion for the Formless, all conceit, excitement and ignorance, and so, aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, enters into and abides in the First Jhāna … progress whereto is difficult and intuition sluggish—then the contact … the faculty of knowledge made perfect … the balance that arises—these … are states that are good.</p>
<p><strong><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs364a' href='#pts-cs364a'>PTS cs 364a</a> What on that occasion is the faculty of knowledge made perfect?</strong></p>
<p>The wisdom that makes for the realization of those truths that have been realized, comprehended, attained to, discerned, and known—the wisdom that is understanding, search, research, searching the Truth, etc.</p>
<p class='pe'>Continue as in §292.</p>
<p>These, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion, these are states that are good.</p>
