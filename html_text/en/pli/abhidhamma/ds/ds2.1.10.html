<p><strong><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs568' href='#pts-cs568'>PTS cs 568</a> Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When an element of representative intellection of the kind termed kiriya has arisen, which is neither good nor bad nor the result of karma, which is accompanied by happiness, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en159' href='#pts-vp-en159'>PTS vp En 159</a> and which has as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible, or what not, then there is</p>

<p>Now these, or whatever other incorporeal, causally induced states there are on that occasion—these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class='pe'>Question and answer on ‘contact’ as above passim.<strong><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs569' href='#pts-cs569'>PTS cs 569</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs570' href='#pts-cs570'>PTS cs 570</a> What on that occasion is self-collectedness?</strong></p>
<p>The stability, solidity, absorbed steadfastness of thought which on that occasion is the absence of distraction, balance, imperturbed mental procedure, quiet, the faculty and the power of concentration—this is the self-collectedness that there then is.</p>
<p><strong><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs571' href='#pts-cs571'>PTS cs 571</a> What on that occasion is the faculty of energy …</strong></p>

<p>When he cultivates rapt meditation in connexion with the universe of Form, and of the kind termed kiriya which is neither good, nor bad, nor the result of karma, and which is concerned with easeful living under present conditions—and so, aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, by earth-wholeness, enters into and abides in the First Jhāna … then there is contact … balance. Now these … are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class='pe'>Repeat in the case of each remaining Jhāna on the Fourfold f and of those on the Fivefold System.<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs578' href='#pts-cs578'>PTS cs 578</a> </p>

<p><strong><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs579' href='#pts-cs579'>PTS cs 579</a> Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When he cultivates rapt meditation in connexion with the universe of the Formless, of the kind termed kiriya, which is neither good, nor bad, nor the result of karma, and is concerned with easeful living under present conditions—and when, by passing wholly beyond all consciousness of form, by the dying out of the consciousness of sensory reaction, by turning the attention from any consciousness of the manifold, he enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of unbounded space—even the Fourth Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease must have been put away, etc… . then there is contact … balance. Now these … are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class='pe'>Here follow, with the same opening formula as in the foregoing answer, the three remaining ‘Jhānas con nected with Formless Existence’. See §§266–268.<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en164' href='#pts-vp-en164'>PTS vp En 164</a> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs580-582' href='#pts-cs580-582'>PTS cs 580-582</a> </p>
