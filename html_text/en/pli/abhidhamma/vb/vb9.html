<h2>9.1. Analysis According to the Discourses</h2>
<p><a class='ref ba' id='ba282' href='#ba282'>BA 282</a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs431' href='#pts-cs431'>PTS cs 431</a> <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli216' href='#pts-vp-pli216'>PTS vp 216</a> The four sense-bases of accomplishment. Herein a monk develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “wish-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”; develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “energy-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”; develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “consciousness-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”; develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “reason-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”.</p>
<h3>9.1.1. Wish as the Basis of Accomplishment</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs432' href='#pts-cs432'>PTS cs 432</a> And how does a monk develop the basis of accomplishment furnished with “wish-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”? If a monk, having made wish dominant, gains <i>samādhi</i>; gains one-pointedness of consciousness. This is called “wish-<i>samādhi</i>”. He engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the non-arising of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the abandoning of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the arising of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the stabilizing, for the collocation, for the increase, for the maturity, for the development, for the completion of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen. These are called “striving-activity”. Thus this “wish-<i>samādhi</i>” and this “striving-activity”, these taken together collectively and briefly go by the name “wish-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs433' href='#pts-cs433'>PTS cs 433</a> Therein what is <span class='term'>wish</span>? That which is wish, act of wishing, desire to do, skilful righteous wish. This is called wish. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli217' href='#pts-vp-pli217'>PTS vp 217</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref ba' id='ba283' href='#ba283'>BA 283</a>Therein what is <span class='term'>samādhi</span>? That which is stability, steadfastness, firmness of consciousness; non-distraction, non-wavering, mental imperturbability, calmness, faculty of <i>samādhi</i>, power of <i>samādhi</i>, right <i>samādhi</i>. This is called <i>samādhi</i>.</p>
<p>Therein what is “<span class='term'>striving-activity</span>”? That which is the arousing of mental energy, toiling, endeavour, aspiring, effort, zeal, perseverance, vigour, stability, unfaltering endeavour, not relinquishing wish, not relinquishing the task, firm hold of the task, energy, faculty of energy, power of energy, right effort. This is called “striving-activity”. Thus of this wish, of this <i>samādhi</i> and of this “striving-activity” he is possessed, well possessed, attained, well attained, endowed, well endowed, furnished. Therefore this is called “furnished with ‘wish-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity’”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs434' href='#pts-cs434'>PTS cs 434</a> “<span class='term'>Accomplishment</span>” means: That which of these <i>dhammas</i> is accomplishment, full accomplishment, act of accomplishing, act of accomplishing fully, gaining, gaining repeatedly, acquiring, acquiring well, contacting, realization, achievement.</p>
<p>“The <span class='term'>basis of accomplishment</span>” means: The aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception, aggregate of volitional activities, aggregate of consciousness of one (in whom the accomplishments have) come to be in the aforesaid manner.</p>
<p>“<span class='term'>Develops the basis of accomplishment</span>” means: These <i>dhammas</i> he pursues, develops, repeats. Therefore this is called “develops the basis of accomplishment”.</p>
<h3>9.1.2. Energy as the Basis of Accomplishment</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs435' href='#pts-cs435'>PTS cs 435</a> And how does a monk develop the basis of accomplishment furnished with “energy-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”? If a monk, having made energy dominant, gains <i>samādhi</i>; gains one-pointedness of consciousness. This is called “energy-<i>samādhi</i>”. He engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the non-arising of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; <span class='pe'>Complete as first example.</span> for the abandoning of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen; <span class='pe'>Complete as first example.</span> for the arising of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the stabilizing, for the collocation, for the increase, for<a class='ref ba' id='ba284' href='#ba284'>BA 284</a> the maturity, for the development, for the completion of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen. These are called “striving-activity”. Thus this “energy-<i>samādhi</i>” and this “striving-activity”, these taken together collectively and briefly go by the name “energy-<i>samādhi</i>, striving-activity”.</p>

If<a class='ref ba' id='ba285' href='#ba285'>BA 285</a> a monk, having made consciousness dominant, gains <i>samādhi</i>; gains one-pointedness of consciousness. This is called “consciousness-<i>samādhi</i>”. He engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the non-arising of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; <span class='pe'>Complete as first example.</span> for the abandoning of bad unskilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen; <span class='pe'>Complete as first example.</span> for the arising of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the stabilizing, for the collocation, for the increase, for the maturity, for the development, for the completion of skilful <i>dhammas</i> that have arisen.
