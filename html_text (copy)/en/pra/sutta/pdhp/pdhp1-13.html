<p class="namo">Hail and Homage to all Buddhas, Dharmas and the Noble Saṅghas.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp1" id="1"></a>Mind precedes thoughts,<br>
mind is their chief, they are impelled by mind,<br>
if with a base mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that, suffering follows him<br>
like a wheel follows the ox’s foot.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp2" id="2"></a>Mind precedes thoughts,<br>
mind is their chief, they are impelled by mind,<br>
if with pure mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that, happiness follows him <br>
like a shadow which does not depart.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp3" id="3"></a>Here he laments, after death he laments,<br>
the wicked one laments in both places,<br>
he laments, he suffers vexation,<br>
seeing the defilement of his own deeds.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp4" id="4"></a>“He abused me, he struck at me,<br>
he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who bear these ill-will<br>
their hatred is never appeased.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp5" id="5"></a>“He abused me, he struck at me,<br>
he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who do not bear these ill-will<br>
their hatred is appeased.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp7" id="7"></a>Living contemplating what is pleasant,<br>
uncontrolled in sense faculties,<br>
not knowing the limit in food,<br>
indolent, low in energy—<br>
Māra surely overthrows that one,<br>
like wind overthrows a weak tree.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp8" id="8"></a>Living contemplating the unpleasant,<br>
well-controlled in sense faculties,<br>
and knowing the limit in food,<br>
faithful, with energy aroused—<br>
Māra does not overthrow that one,<br>
just as wind does not overthrow a mountain made of rock.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp9" id="9"></a>If you should find a prudent, wise companion,<br>
one who lives well, a wise one,<br>
overcoming all your troubles<br>
you should live with that one, glad and mindful.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp10" id="10"></a>If you do not find a prudent, wise companion,<br>
one who lives well, a wise one,<br>
like a king who abandons his conquered kingdom,<br>
one should live alone like a solitary elephant in the forest.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp11" id="11"></a>It is better to live alone,<br>
there can be no companionship with a fool,<br>
one should live alone and not do anything bad,<br>
unconcerned like a solitary elephant in the forest.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp12" id="12"></a>He who, through desire, hatred, fear or delusion,<br>
transgresses Dhamma,<br>
his fame diminishes,<br>
like the moon in the dark fortnight.</p>
<p><a class="mc" data-uid="pdhp13" id="13"></a>He who, through desire, hatred, fear or delusion,<br>
does not transgress Dhamma,<br>
his fame increases,<br>
like the moon in the bright fortnight.</p>
