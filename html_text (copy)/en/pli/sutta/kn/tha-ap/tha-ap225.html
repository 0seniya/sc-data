<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2384"></a>
I was a deer-hunter back then,<br>
within a grove in the forest.<br>
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient. <a class="vjw" id="vjw1"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2385"></a>
I <span class="add">then</span> gave a piece of meat to<br>
Vipassi <span class="add">Buddha</span>, the Great Sage.<br>
I exercised overlordship<br>
in the world including its gods. <a class="vjw" id="vjw2"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2386"></a>
Because of giving meat <span class="add">back then,</span><br>
gems came into being for me.<br>
I had two jewels in <span class="add">this</span> world<br>
for attainment of worldly things. <a class="vjw" id="vjw3"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2387"></a>
I am enjoying everything<br>
as the profit of a meat-gift.<br>
I have a body which is soft<br>
<span class="add">and</span> wisdom, a sharp intellect. <a class="vjw" id="vjw4"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2388"></a>
In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I gave <span class="add">him</span> that meat at that time,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of <span class="add">giving</span> meat. <a class="vjw" id="vjw5"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2389"></a>
<span class="add">And</span> in the fourth aeon ago<br>
there was one lord of the people.<br>
He was named Mahārohita,<br>
a wheel-turning king with great strength. <a class="vjw" id="vjw6"></a></p>
<p><a class="jw" id="jw2390"></a>
The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class="add">I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class="vjw" id="vjw7"></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Dverataniya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
<p class="endsutta">The legend of Dverataniya Thera is finished.</p>
