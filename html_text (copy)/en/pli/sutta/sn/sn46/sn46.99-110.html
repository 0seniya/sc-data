<p>Kindred Sayings on the Limbs of Wisdom</p>
<h1>99. Strength</h1>

<h2>i. Seclusion</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Just as, monks, whatsoever deeds requiring strength are done, all of them are done in dependence on the earth, with the earth for their support, even so a monk, depending on virtue, supported by virtue, cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, makes much, of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
<p>And how does a monk, depending on virtue, supported by virtue, cultivate the seven limbs of wisdom, make much, of the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>That is how a monk depending on virtue, supported by virtue, cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, makes much, of the seven limbs of wisdom.”</p>

<h2>iii. Ending in the Deathless</h2>
<p>“Just as, monks, whatsoever deeds requiring strength are done, all of them are done in dependence on the earth, with the earth for their support, even so a monk, depending on virtue, supported by virtue, cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, makes much, of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
<p>And how does a monk, depending on virtue, supported by virtue, cultivate the seven limbs of wisdom, make much, of the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

<p>And what, monks, are the states that are to be realized by full comprehension?</p>
<p>They are knowledge and release.</p>
<p>These are the states to be realized by full comprehension.</p>
<p>And what, monks, are the states that are to be cultivated by full comprehension?</p>
<p>They are calm and insight.</p>
<p>These are the states to be cultivated by full comprehension.</p>
<p>And how does a monk, cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom, realize, abandon, fully comprehend and cultivate (these states)?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>
<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end;</p>

<p>he cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which plunges into the deathless, which has the deathless for its aim, which has the deathless for its end.</p>
<p>That is how monks, a monk who cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, who makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom, by full comprehension realizes those states which are by full comprehension to be fully understood;</p>
<p>those states that are to be abandoned by full comprehension, by full comprehension he abandons;</p>

<h2>iv. Ending in Nibbāna</h2>
<p>“Suppose, monks, a guest-house.</p>
<p>Thither come folk from the eastern quarter, who take up residence therein.</p>
<p>Thither come folk from the western quarter, who take up residence therein.</p>
<p>Thither come folk from the northern quarter, who take up residence therein.</p>
<p>Thither come folk from the southern quarter, who take up residence therein.</p>
<p>Noblemen and brahmins, commoners and serfs.</p>
<p>Even so, monks, a monk who cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom, who makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom, by full comprehension realizes those states which are by full comprehension to be fully understood.</p>

<p>What, monks, are the states to be realized by full comprehension?</p>
<p>To that question you must reply:</p>
<p>‘It is the five factors that have to do with grasping.’</p>
<p>What five?</p>
<p>They are these:</p>
<p>The body-factor that has to do with grasping, the factor of feeling that has to do with grasping, the perception-factor that has to do with grasping, the activities-factor that has to do with grasping, the consciousness-factor that has to do with grasping.</p>

<p>And how does a monk, cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom, realize, abandon, fully comprehend and cultivate (these states)?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which flows to Nibbāna, which slides to Nibbāna, which tends to Nibbāna;</p>

<h1>110. The River</h1>
<h2>i. Seclusion</h2>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Suppose, monks, the river Ganges, that flows, slides and tends towards the east, and there comes a great crowd of folk, armed with pick and basket, saying:</p>
<p>‘We will make this river Ganges flow, slide and tend towards the west.’</p>
<p>What think ye, monks?</p>
<p>Would that great crowd of folk make the river Ganges flow, slide and tend towards the west?”</p>
<p>“Surely not, lord.”</p>
<p>“And why not?”</p>
<p>“Because, lord, the river Ganges flows, slides and tends towards the east, it were no easy thing to make it flow, slide and tend towards the west; insomuch that fatigue and vexation would be the lot of that great crowd of folk.”</p>
<p>“Just so, monks, if the rajah's royal ministers or his friends or boon companions or kinsmen or blood relatives were to come to a monk who is cultivating and making much of the Ariyan eightfold way, and were to seek to entice him with wealth, saying:</p>
<p>‘Come, good man!</p>
<p>Why should these yellow robes torment you?</p>
<p>Why parade about with shaven crown and bowl?</p>
<p>Come!</p>
<p>Return to the lower life and enjoy possessions and do deeds of merit,’</p>
<p>for that monk so cultivating and making much of the seven limbs of wisdom return to the lower life is impossible.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>Because, monks, that monk's heart has for many a long day been bent on detachment, inclined to detachment, turned towards detachment, so that there is no possibility for him to return to the lower life.</p>
<p>And how, monks, does a monk cultivate and make much of the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>That is how monks, a monk cultivates and makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
<h2>ii. Ending in Restraint of Passion</h2>
<p>“Suppose, monks, the river Ganges, that flows, slides and tends towards the east, and there comes a great crowd of folk, armed with pick and basket, saying:</p>
<p>‘We will make this river Ganges flow, slide and tend towards the west.’</p>
<p>What think ye, monks?</p>
<p>Would that great crowd of folk make the river Ganges flow, slide and tend towards the west?”</p>
<p>“Surely not, lord.”</p>
<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>And how, monks, does a monk cultivate and make much of the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>
