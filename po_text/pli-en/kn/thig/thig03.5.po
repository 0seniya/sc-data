# Norman suggests a number of re-readings of this verse, but only partly incorporates these in his translation. I agree with his suggestions, and translate accordingly. He says "amma" is hypermetric and probably unoriginal; in addition, if it is accepted, it requires that the verse be spoken by the (presumably heaven-born) spirit of the dead daughter. A simpler reading is that the verse is spoken by someone else—likely the Buddha—and amma was added later. Further, jīva/ā cannot be a vocative of jīvā and is most likely second person imperative (= jīvahi).

# Again following Norman's suggestion. By trying, albeit clumsily, to capture the implied play on words, there is no need for the rather astonishing circumstance that 84,000 people in the same place had the same name. The point is, rather, that everyone we know is "living" until they are not.
