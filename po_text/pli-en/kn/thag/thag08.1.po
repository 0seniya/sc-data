# Yamamase is an imperative, "we must control ourselves". Both in Thag 4.3 and Thag 8.1, however, the context clearly indicates that a pun on Yama, the god of death, is intended. This is confirmed by the commentary, see Norman's note on Thag 4.3. I try to translate in a way that captures both "must restrain ourselves" and "we will go to presence of Death".
